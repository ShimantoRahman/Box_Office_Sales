There's nothing to it but if you like watching funny spy movies be my guest and go watch this horrific film"", 'After 3 minutes one of my sons whispered to me ""What is this? I don\'t like it.""\nI think that about sums it up - What is this movie? What is it trying to be? And when, oh when, will it end?', ""It's a bit too violent and has too many pointless, non-story progressing scenes to be a kids' movie but it is definitely not for adults. All the good bits are in the 30-second advert that convinced us to go and see it."", 'We saw a morning session at the cinema. At 10.57am I checked my watch, at 11.01am I checked my watch and was stunned to find time had completely slowed.', 'Although Chloe Coleman is an excellent actress and very watchable, every other character was unbelievable, unappealing and terribly written. What a waste of clever people like Kristen Schaal (or as I call her, Mel from Flight of the Conchords).', ""My older son thought it was okay but when pressed, couldn't name a favourite scene. The younger one gave up and ended up playing a game on my phone about an hour in."", ""My Spy is a ridiculously clueless film - it essentially has no idea what it wants to be. One thing it is for sure is that it's incredibly boring, cringe and unfunny, with forced charm and emotion. The film's story completely deviates from a coming-of-age story to an action film. The dialogue and performances were god awful and nothing about the underdeveloped characters made you engaged.\nPlease remember this is my opinion, others may have felt different\n2/10"", 'Jj and bobbi make for a good laugh. Has its moments', 'My Spy (2020) in my opinion is a seemingly comedy/family/kiddie movie unfortunately it is none of the above. The film includes vulgar language used bot both the child and adult actors. I could hardly believe that the actor David Bautisa had accepted such a corny weak comedic role. I could not relate to the vulgar language. What is the message? That its coold for kids to behave like grownups?', 'Great film for the family (with older children) to see. Love the connection between JJ and Sophie - funny, entertaining and some good action scenes.', 'I saw this movie with my 4 daughters and we all Loved it! We are not professional movie reviewers or anything like that but absolutely enjoyed all the different emotions in this movie, it was Charming, Comical, Witty, Action Packed, Heart Warming, Suspenseful, and more! We also loved the relationship between David Batista & Chloe Coleman..... just Precious, and their performances charming! There was some violence and language but nothing bloody or disgusting.', ""So as the school holidays comes to an end in Australia we finish off with yet another release of a children's film. The funny part is that it's a bit like a recipe, as it contains parts of all the other films I've reviewed already these summer holidays! You take the machismo of Playing with Fire, add the silliness of Farmageddon, plus a touch of heart from Frozen 2, not forgetting some funny one-liners from Jumanji, finish it off with some espionage from Spies in Disguise, garnish it with the child-friendly action of Star Wars and you have a perfectly satisfying film called My Spy. Mr. 9 and I ate it up (and reviewed it) last week when we saw it at Palace Nova cinemas!"", ""JJ (Dave Bautista) is an undercover CIA agent who is not exactly inconspicuous. After a weapons deal goes horribly wrong he is assigned to surveillance duty with tech-specialist Bobbi (Kristen Schaal). Their job is to keep an eye on a mother and daughter who may be in danger if a global terrorist finds out where they live. But JJ isn't exactly qualified for surveillance duty and it's not long before he is caught out by clever 9 year old Sophie (Chloe Coleman), the girl he is supposed to be watching. The two work out an arrangement where Sophie won't tell her mum Kate (Parisa Fitz-Henley) that they are being watched, but only if JJ teaches Sophie how to become a spy. The two don't exactly get along but over time a friendship develops, much to the chagrin of Bobbi who knows that this is a serious breach of the CIA surveillance rules. But, as expected, trouble inevitably finds its way into Sophie and Kate's life and we are left to see whether the spy training that JJ gave this precocious 9 year old will succeed or fail spectacularly."", ""THE GOOD\nFor a film like this, with a storyline that has been done to death plenty of times before, I was actually surprised at how much I liked My Spy. But my enjoyment didn't come so much from former WWE wrestler Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy, Stuber) but the confidence and acting ability of kid actor Chloe Coleman (Big Little Lies). In a lot of these 'kids teaching adults to be kids' films the child usually comes across as bratty and unlikeable but Coleman finds a great balance of clever, likeable and entertaining which Mr. 9 and I really found appealing. Also when you have a great comedy support cast like Kristen Schaal (Gravity Falls, Toy Story 4) and Ken Jeong (The Hangover movies) the laughter also lifts a notch too.\nMr.9: I really liked Sophie in this film when she is learning to become a spy. The part where she keeps looking at the explosions behind her was really funny because JJ had to keep turning her head around."", ""THE BAD\nBautista seems to have found his niche in Hollywood at taking characters who are large, muscle-bound, meat heads with not much going on upstairs. Alongside professional comedians like Schaal and Jeong his comedic acting can sometimes be painful to watch as he tries to compete with them for laughs but comes across more forced than natural.\nAnd for those of you looking for an action film this is not entirely the case with My Spy. Although it is bookended with big, action, set pieces it is more a romantic comedy as much of the film is taken up with telling the story of JJ's budding friendship with Sophie and finding a possible love interest with her mum, Kate."", 'Mr. 9: It got really boring in the middle because there was no action happening. The bad guy was there at the start and then disappeared until the end of the film. It seemed different from what the trailer showed.', ""THE UGLY\nFor those of you who are familiar with Dave Bautista you would know that he is bald up top. Yet for some unknown reason the hair and makeup team decided to either spray paint or put a toupee on top of his head which is jet black and extremely short. It looks so unnatural and left me staring at the top of his head for most of the movie. Somewhat in shock and somewhat in fascination I couldn't stop looking at this unusual follicle choice."", ""I didn't have high hopes for My Spy after seeing the trailer but walked out pleasantly surprised at how a completely unoriginal film could be so enjoyable. Bautista's charm and Coleman's likeability really carry this film above 'just another comedy'. An enjoyable film to finish off the school holidays!"", 'THREE AND A HALF TOUPEES OUT OF FIVE', ""Mr. 9: All the spy stuff was fun and the movie was also pretty funny although it had a lot of swearing for a 'PG' film. Three and a half out five."", ""Ok, first of all you shouldn't have to high expectations when going into this movie, because if you do, you will probably get dissapointed..."", ""But let's be real. If you only need a fun and simple movie, without a twistet story you need to stay focused on, then it is a fun little movie where you can just turn your brain of and enjoy it."", 'The story is fairly simple, sometimes even predictable, there aren\'t any big moments you will still remember in a few years, there is no \'real espionage action"" which you might hope for and of course you could have done more with it. And I must be honest. I myself expected something a bit different from this movie in the beginning and by the trailers. But I like what it is. I can enjoy the charackters and their interactions, I can laugh at a lot of the jokes, and I can simply sit here and enjoy the simple story, without the need to figure out what is happening and I think this is something you could need on a bad day.', 'So If you want a fun and little movie for your evening after a hard day or for you and your Family, this movie might be worth a Shot.', 'Dave Batista does a bit of an Arnie in this film about a CIA agent and a precocious 9 year old girl he is surveilling. Good solid family fun with a few laughs and charming performances. 3 Stars\nGeorge: although it was a kids movie I enjoyed it and it was so far fetched I enjoyed it all the more. If a CIA agent is like this heaven help us! 3.5 Stars', 'A friend gave me early access tickets to go see this with my daughter for her birthday.', ""I've got to say we thought it was hilarious, but it's not a movie for critics or someone who is not comfortable with having their kids hear cuss words. As for me and my daughter it was great. It has a little bit of a romcom vibe, mixed with an unconventional mentor mentee relationship with action scenes. Sophie and JJ's relationship is adorable! Also loved that Ken Jeong (The Hangover) makes a small appearance in this too!"", 'Great movie to take your mature kids to.

And Bautista makes this bemuscled buffoon easy to root for from the start. When spying on a single mother, whose ex is a Russian terrorist, he notices that the nine-year-old daughter has found their hidden cameras. “What do we do?” his partner (Kristen Schaal) asks.

Another rising star with comedic timing, Coleman is as precocious as her character, Sophie. The nine year old daughter is a natural at espionage.

Thankfully, they do. In a climax that gives Segal a chance to flex his chops as an action filmmaker, the terrorists return. And to the surprise of JJ, Chloe and her mom, Kate (Pariza Fitz-Henley), they return with lots of guns. This serves as ammunition for some impressive shootouts.', 'Starting in the apartment, which turns into a car chase, which results in a plane hanging over a cliff, Segal takes an assortment of otherwise mundane images (a car skirting around a corner, a plane on a runway) and turns them into a cohesive, thrilling finale.

They all end up headlining a very bad kids’ movie. Sure, a lot of actors end up appearing in one bad kid’s movie because it offers them an easy paycheck and it’s a movie they can take their children to go see so they can prove they have an actual job but wrestlers almost make a sport out of it. Our latest addition to this is Dave Bautista who I kind of hoped wouldn’t have to do this because he has the ', ' and ', 'movies which would be enough to show any future children that he was cool. He didn’t need this, he didn’t need this to be the first major thing he did after ', ' (', ' came out BEFORE ', ', if you can believe it). I’ll give it this much, it’s not as painful as ', ' Robert Downey Jr decided to do after ', '.', ' features a plot that feels weirdly familiar. CIA operative JJ Cena (Dave Bautista) is on the last ounce of goodwill from the agency after he ‘botches’ a mission. His last chance to prove he should be with the agency involves doing surveillance on the Newton family, Kate (Parisa Fitz-Henley) and her 9-year-old daughter Sophie (Chloe Coleman). His only assistance is tech analyst Bobbi Ault (Kristen Schaal) and sure enough, while he is meant to be secret in his spying, Sophie finds out that JJ Cena (No relation to John Cena, though god I want a film with John Cena with Dave Bautista as brothers) and Bobbi are spying on her and blackmails them into becoming a friend of her family. Shenanigans ensue that rely heavily on the comedic trope of the large muscle-bound man being asked to do typically girly things and a lot of lying that can be revealed during the climax of the film.', 'This kind of film feels like it’s a relic from the 90s. Arnold Schwarzenegger would’ve been making this film if the script had been around back then, and judging by how the jokes feel I wouldn’t be shocked if a very early draft of this was around back then because the jokes feel like they were written a decade ago, back when you could believe that the CIA would send a giant wall of muscle out on a job that requires sitting and doing nothing. The jokes also just feel generic, like they’re going off a checklist. We have the 50 Shades references, we have the awkward classroom scene, the comedic ice skating scene where the oversized muscle man can’t skate and of course we end on a big group dance number to whatever song happens to be popular at the time of filming (in this case, the song was I Like It by Cardi B). If you can think of a cliché idea that fits with the “Large muscular man forced to look after small child” genre, it appears here.', 'What makes this film watchable (not good, but watchable) is the absolutely game-for-anything performance by Dave Bautista who keeps reminding us that Drax isn’t a fluke, he just has some spectacular comedic chops that works well. It’s something about his dry delivery that makes his lines work and he does it with the most serious look on his face. He’s also clearly not afraid to look like a fool, pulling out some physical comedy and dorky dad dance moves that can pull out a few laughs while making him endearing. I wish he was picking better-written films though, ones that gave him a lot more good jokes to work with instead of trying his best to make the material he’s been given funny. Sadly the actual jokes and scenarios are either just flat out unfunny, or feel so out of place in 2020. There’s an entire subplot involving the gay neighbours who give Bautista a makeover before a big date… there are so many 90s romcoms that did this same set of jokes. Heck, to put a cap on it, it’s a gay couple where one partner is silent and the other does all the talking… that’s Ruth and Barb from ', ' which is a movie you probably didn’t see, but I’m guessing the writers did because it’s too much of a coincidence that ', ' and ', 'both have an interracial LGBTQIA couple where the black one talks and the white one makes unintelligible grunts.', 'That gay couple in the movie does make me need to point out that this film goes a good job of representation by showing a diverse mix of ethnicities and sexualities throughout the film. Sure, some might be a little problematic but at least they’re there. ', ' might not be great, but it proves how obscenely easy it is to do some basic representation. Even though they don’t actually give them characters (because this is a badly written film, have I mentioned that yet?), at least they’re there and on-screen for long periods. Other films, take a note from ', ' and just make some gay characters or some people of colour as part of your film. The film probably could’ve worked just the same with someone other than Ken Jeong in the role of the FBI leader, but they put Ken in that role and suddenly there’s some serious representation here… I know this is a silly tangent but there isn’t much to talk about in the actual film and I feel like this discussion needs to keep happening until it stops feeling like a big deal that a below-average family comedy has a diverse cast of characters.', ' is, at best, basic. There are some laughs because of the genuinely great lead and no one is outright bad, but it feels like we’ve seen this before. Hell, we’ve seen this done before and done a lot better. With jokes that only land when the actors pull out 135% of their talent and a story that’s so generic that you could literally go in, see the first 15 minutes and then perfectly describe the ending. Littered with minor issues that can be distracting, it just never rises much above harmlessly mediocre.

For the concept of waiting, watching, gathering intel, that bores him. He’d rather grab a gun, throw a fist or grenade, and then walk away as something explodes. Oh, while having an excellent line before he defeats his opponent. But, because the CIA doesn’t operate like that, JJ is on thin ice and forced onto an assignment, with a tech person named Bobbi, in which he is forced to do what he hates the most: Surveillance. And because he hates it so much, he slips up, and a nine-year-old, Sophie, ends up walking in on his operation. Ultimately leading to her coercing JJ to become her friend and maybe someone for her mother, Kate, to spend time with.', 'I don’t think I can say enough how funny this was – especially if you are someone who LOVES sarcasm. For whether it is Sophie being a little smart a$$, this gay character name Carlos throwing shade, Bobbi being annoyed by how much time JJ spends with Sophie, and not training her, there is so much passive-aggressive comedy. Though, that’s not all! Also, throughout the film, there are awkward comedic moments, like JJ dancing, as shown in the trailer, Britney Spears playing during an action scene, and just random WTF moments that, in the audience I was with, made both parents and kids laugh.', 'Like many, a part of me felt Bautista’s career, early on, was going to try to find a means of following the path Dwayne Johnson forged, and I honestly thought “My Spy” would be similar to Johnson’s “Tooth Fairy” or “The Game Plan” in terms of big, beefy guy, who doesn’t seem like he’d be good with kids, being made a fool by one and/or his size being the foundation of every joke. That isn’t really done here. Instead, while JJ is occasionally the butt of a joke, he gets to have real relationships.', 'Bobbi, for example, who is enamored by him, they develop a cute partnership that may not necessarily be equal to what we see between him and Sophie, or even Kate, but it is notable enough, and certainly funny enough, for you to want to remind yourself where you’ve seen Kristen Schaal before. Since, with her one-liners, she really pushes herself to the point of, while she isn’t one of the names on the poster, there are multiple attempts to squeeze her name on there if not steal the movie.', 'Switching things to Kate and Sophie, with Kate, you get a bit of heart since she helps us see, through a more adult lens, what JJ has gone through before we met him. Also, while somewhere between a love interest and potential victim, her relationship with JJ reminds you that Kate isn’t really either. She can fight, and while she does have an interest in JJ, her role isn’t dedicated to his needs or making him into that attractive action hero.', 'Leaving Sophie. As you can imagine, a father/daughter dynamic is pushed, and while Sophie might take a little getting used to, once you accept she is just a precocious 9 year old, you appreciate what she brings out of JJ. She isn’t the daughter he never got to have but is perhaps one of the first people he has invested his time into for quite some time. And as they grow attached to one another, you begin to forget it is Bautista on screen because you become so engrossed in his relationship with little miss Coleman.', 'If you are like me and enjoy it when the villain sees himself as the good guy, or there is some complication that makes it so they aren’t outright evil, then you won’t like the main villain in the film. He is simple, just focused on making a bomb, and doesn’t why this is his goal. Money isn’t mentioned, revenge, or anything like that. The sole thing we get is that he is trying to compete/ outdo his brother. Someone who is barely in the movie, so that motivation is easy to forget.', 'Admittedly, Sophie is the type of kid who, if you don’t interact with children who aren’t sheltered, may seem a bit much. In fact, you may think how she gets over on JJ, and Bobbi, it dampens things since she makes them both look like idiots. Add in we see her personal life, which includes being bullied and feeling ostracized, you may either develop sympathy for the kid or have the attitude of, “Well, if you weren’t such a brat…”', 'This isn’t to imply we didn’t like Sophie, but I do feel it needs to be said some may not like her.', 'You could say Carlos comes off problematic. If only due to the fact he is a flamboyant gay Black man who seems more so a caricature than an actual person. However, if you are not someone that needs characters to be politically correct, you will find Carlos and his partner Todd, hilarious.', 'When it comes to “My Spy,” it has very few issues. For us, as an adult, the issue is the villain is very basic and forgettable. However, for parents, I do feel the marketing could dupe you into thinking this is by no means as vulgar and violent as it is. Also, some may think Sophie is a little too grown but, with interacting with this next generation, let me tell you, these kids are by no means like those we saw on Nick Jr. anymore.', 'Leading to why we rated this worth seeing: It’s funny, and Bautista really proves that he, unlike some other MCU alumni, can be the driving force of an original property. On top of that, while there may always be a desire to compare his career to Dwayne Johnson, I do feel, at this point, Bautista has proven himself to maybe not be on par box office wise, especially if you omit his roles in the MCU, but I’d say, quality-wise, in terms of his role choices, Bautista is giving Johnson a run for his money.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Handsome, clever, and rich, Emma Woodhouse is a restless queen bee without rivals in her sleepy little town. In this glittering satire of social class and the pain of growing up, Emma must adventure through misguided matches and romantic missteps to find the love that has been there all along.""]";"['I loved the look of ""Emma"" from the trailer. And I was not disappointed. It is a simply sublime piece of comic entertainment.', ""Emma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor-Joy) is a rich, privileged 21 year-old looking after her elderly and quirky father (Bill Nighy) in the family stately home. She has never loved, despite the persistent presence of 'family friend' George Knightley (Johnny Flynn), but finds it entertaining to engage in matchmaking, particularly in respect to her somewhat lower class friend Harriet Smith (Mia Goth). Emma has high ambitions for Harriet... ideas significantly above what her social station and looks might suggest."", 'Emma has her sights on a dream.... the mystery man Frank Churchill (Callum Turner), son of wealthy local landowner Mr Weston (Rupert Graves). She has never actually met him, but is obsessed with his myth. #fangirl. As a source of immense annoyance to her, but often a source of valuable information on news of Churchill, is the village \'old maid\' Miss Bates (Miranda Hart). ""Such fun""!', ""But Emma's perfect life is about to face sticky times, as her machinations fail to yield the expected results and a stray comment, at a disastrous picnic, threatens to damage both her reputation and her social standing."", 'If you like your movies full of action and suspense, you are digging in the wrong place. ""Emma"" is slow... glacially slow... wallowing in beautiful bucolic scenes (with superb cinematography by Christopher Blauvelt); gorgeous costumes by Alexandra Byrne; and hair styling by Marese Langan.', 'The movie also benefits from a joyfully tight and funny script by debut screenwriter Eleanor Catton (a Man-Booker prize winner). This picks relentlessly at the strata of the class system set up by Jane Austen\'s novel: ""Every body has their level"" spits spurned suitor Mr Elton (Josh O\'Connor).', 'I know Anya Taylor-Joy as the spirited Casey from ""Split"" and ""Glass"": she was impressive in ""Split""; less so for me in the disappointing ""Glass"". But here, I found her UTTERLY mesmerising. She has such striking features - those eyes! - that she fully inhabits the role of the beautiful heiress who haunts multiple men sequentially. I even muttered the word ""Oscar nomination"" at the end of the film: though we are too early in the year to seriously go there.', 'An even bigger surprise was the actor playing George Knightley. Johnny Flynn has been in a number of TV shows I haven\'t seen, and a few films I haven\'t seen either (e.g. ""Beast""). But I had the nagging feeling I knew him really well. The illustrious Mrs Movie Man clocked him: he\'s the Cineworld ""plaid man""! (For those outside the UK or not patrons of Cineworld cinemas, he was the \'star\' of a Cineworld advert that played over and Over AND OVER again for months on end before every film I saw. Arrrgggghhhh!).', 'Here, Flynn is excellent as the frustrated and brooding Austen-hunk. He even gets away with an ar*e-shot within a U-certificate!', 'Particularly strong in the supporting cast are Bill Nighy (being delightfully more restrained in his performance); Miranda Hart (being ""Miranda"", but perfectly cast) and Mia Goth (memorable for that eel-bath in ""A Cure for Wellness"").', 'And a big thank-you for a web review in the online Radio Times for naming one of the comical (and bizarrely uncredited) footmen as Angus Imrie - - the truly disturbed stepson of Claire in ""Fleabag"". It was driving me crazy where I knew him from!', 'The one criticism I would have is that I found the (perfectly fine and well-fitting) music, by David Schweitzer and Isobel Waller-Bridge (sister of Phoebe) poorly mixed within the soundtrack. There were times when I found it overly intrusive, suddenly ducking under dialogue and then BLASTING out again. Sometimes music should be at the forefront.... but more often it should be barely perceptible.', 'As you might guess....\n...I loved this one. The story is brilliant (obsv!); the film is simply gorgeous to look at; the locations (including the village of Lower Slaughter in the Cotswolds and Wilton House - near me - in Salisbury) are magnificent and a blessing for the English Tourist Board.', 'All the more impressive then that this is the directorial feature of video/short director Autumn de Wilde.', 'This comes with a ""highly recommended"" from both myself and the illustrious Mrs Movie-Man.', ""(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on Facebook or the web.)"", ""Autumn de Wilde's Emma, with Anya Taylor-Joy and Johnny Flynn, is not my cup of tea, I'm afraid. My review might be influenced by how much I love Jane Austen's novel and how many times I've watched the 2009 miniseries, but I always give every adaptation a try. And I can't really judge if what I was watching would make sense to an Austen virgin, shall we say, so what seemed disjointed and rushed to me might work perfectly for others."", ""I'll start with the good: I loved the costumes and the interiors, which were sumptuously beautiful. The wood-shaving ringlets on the women and the high collars on the men were distracting, though. And of course Anya Taylor-Joy made for a quirky and regal Emma (Austenites will be pleased to note that she has perfect posture.) I also loved how Anya Taylor-Joy and Amber Anderson as Jane actually played the pianoforte during the Coles' party (but could have done without Mr Knightley's contribution, when Frank Churchill is supposed to be singing with Jane). BUT. The music was horrendously jarring, alternating between Hanna Barbera cartoon incidentals and freakish folk music. The supporting characters suffered once again - I couldn't honestly tell the difference between Mrs Weston, Mrs Knightley and Mrs Elton, except that Isabella was for some reason a complete cow in this version, and Mr Elton and Frank Churchill were also interchangeable (perhaps that's why Elton never seemed to be without his dog collar, to help tell them apart). Bill Nighy's Mr Woodhouse was a weird combination of fusspot and Edwardian fop, and Johnny Flynn's Mr Knightley strayed way off character by stripping off in his first scene and never really recovered for me. (Apparently, that was a way of 'humanising' the character because he is always 'mansplaining' - very woke.) Anya wasn't kidding when she talked about the focus being on 'bodily functions', by the way - not only are we 'treated' to Knightley's backside, but Emma hitches up her skirts to warm her bare arse by the fire, and the 'cannot make speeches' proposal scene is a bloody mess. Literally. The script leans so heavily on lines from the novel that I think Eleanor Catton thought she was writing an essay for an English Lit exam - Austenites will be happy, but there was no feeling behind any of the grand words. When Emma and Mr Knightley argue, they constantly shout over each other, for instance, instead of the usual playful back and forth."", ""The whole film felt like a weird mashup between a stage musical and a Victorian farce, with choreographed servants and slapstick humour. There was also a lot of 1996 Emma in there, taking pastel and pastoral scenery from the film and Andrew Davies' wearisome obsession with wealth from the television two-parter. Not on a sliding scale of Emma and Miss Bates, but in how Mr Knightley's strawberry picking party turns into a National Trust promotional video for Wilton House, Salisbury. There's also a lot of emphasis on servants dressing their masters and mistresses, presumably to fit in more scenes of 'natural nudity'."", ""I went, I watched, I did my duty to Emma. But I think I'll stick with the 2009 miniseries."", ""First of all, let me start by saying that I enjoy pretty much every Austen adaptation - this was no exception.\nSecond of all, let's draw the comparison between a movie and cake. I came into this movie knowing full well what type of cake I both wanted and expected it to be and was not disappointed."", ""Story: The same story we know and love - no unexpected twists or new storytelling methods (like the timeline changeup of the new Little Women). I wanted a delightful butter cake and that's exactly what I got - no wild new flavour combinations. It's a delightlfully fun, occasionally ridiculous, romp. I did enjoy the little extra Mr Nightly affection we get to see in the version - makes the romance feel a little less sudden."", ""Visual: If it were a cake, 'Emma' would be the most repinned, insta-worthy new buttercream cake on the block. Every single scene was shot absolutely beautifully and with so much attention to detail. The soft colours and pretty scenery make every shot look like what we all wish our wedding photos came out like. They play up a bit more of the Woodhouse/Knightly wealth and there is some sumptuous decore to enjoy."", ""Acting: I'm a Miranda Hart fan and I'm glad to say she did not disappoint. She brought the perfect mix of 'ridiculous' and 'sweet/pitiable' to Miss Bates. The rest of the cast did a very solid job and of course Bill Nighy is always a great addition to any ensemble. If the cast is the structural integrity of the cake, this cake isn't going to flop."", ""All in all, I'd say it's exactly as it should be."", 'I have previously seen three TV versions of Emma, and the 1990s Hollywood film with Gwyneth Paltrow - which I find excessively sentimental. Emma is not my favourite Austen novel, but the adaptation used for the 2020 film version is generally very good. One or two specifics are omitted, but this is inevitable in compression to the running time of just over two hours.', ""As all reviews have noted, the film is beautifully designed and shot. Some of the design may even be thought to be over the top, but I thought that was consonant with the mannered approach of the cast, an approach which works well in making this essentially a comedy of manners as well as a love story. The detective story element of the novel doesn't go for very much - little is made of the piano, and Frank Churchill's slip in knowing about Dr Perry's carriage is omitted."", ""I thought Mia Goth's well-rounded performance of Harriet the best I have seen, and it is certainly difficult to take one's eyes off Anya Taylor-Joy in the titular lead. Other female performances are perhaps more so-so, although Chloe Pirie's harassed Isabella is interesting. The comedic Mr Elton would be well over the top in some adaptations but just about fits in here. Other male roles are adequately filled even though the portrayal of john Knightly is slightly bizarre. Bill Nighy is...well, Bill Nighy, this time with amazing costume."", 'I enjoyed it, and I intend to see it again soon. Overall I would just favour the 1996 Kate Beckinsale ITV version but this is close behind and in some ways better', 'Fun, stylistic, and is basically everything I wanted from the film. The color palette was absolutely gorgeous. I really enjoyed this film and I think any audience member will If they are into period pieces', ""I have a keen historical interest in the Regency period and I could find no fault in this spectacular recreation of the time and place. The photography drew me intimately into the action, the costumes male and female were gorgeous, the hats outrageous and straight out of Gillray and Rowlandson cartoons. Despite knowing the book and numerous screen depictions, I am sure I have never before laughed so openly or so frequently, at the sublime visual reactions of all cast members to telling points in the dialogue. As an example, Emma's face when Jane starts to play is an absolute picture. I sat through this very familiar tale with bated breath in anticipation of this ingenious and refreshing treatment of the development of the action. It would be unfair to single out individuals - a superb team effort."", ""Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich. I recently watched the 1996 version with Gwyneth Paltrow in the leading role to get an idea of the story of the film going into this one. I love Anya Taylor-Joy so much. I've seen every one of her films apart from Marrowbone. I was so excited to see her in yet another period piece but this time in a sly comedy. I ended up really enjoying this film. Its got laughs, love, class, and even a deft touch of sadness."", '\nThe film is about a a wealthy 21 year old girl named Emma, who meddles in the lives of those around her. She tries to set her friend up to a man she is not romantically attracted to. As time goes by Emma discovers that trying to fix peoples lives does not always work and then she herself becomes romantically inclined. Along the way Emma realizes how manipulative and haughty she is and the impact that it has on those who are around here. The film also stars Mia Goth, Johnny Flynn, and Bill Nighy.', ""\nThe attention to detail and the production and costume design are absolutely superb. The film is rich with its intricate detail to period and the nobility involved. The film also possesses vibrant cinematography and camerawork. Its a really nice film to look at in a technical aspect. Anya Taylor-Joy is a talent and she's fantastic in this role. Emma can be despicable at times but there's an allure to her character and you can not help but want to be around her. The performances all around are great. I love seeing Mia Goth getting meaningful work, and I've never seen Bill Nighy have such a keen eye for a chilly draft."", ""\nThe film just seems more attuned and in sync with Austen's novel than the 1996 version. It embodies a wide range of emotions and can be hilarious with no dialogue at all. The cast have good chemistry and Autumn de Wilde shows a great touch in her impressive directorial debut. I think this film was great fun and is something I want to check out again because I found great (Anya Taylor) joy watching this."", '\nThe best part of my night though without a doubt is actually meeting the leading lady on the street after the premiere. She was present for a live Q and A and overall this was quite the experience. I am in heaven!', 'Unfortunately for me, this version of Emma was more a miss than a hit. It was too slow & failed to draw me in. Some of the scenes were just too long or superfluous, making me wish for them to hurry up to get to the good bits. Visually speaking it was lovely & depicted the Regency period well. But the soundtrack was often jarring & distracting rather than enhancing a scene. The odd choir singing is a case in point.', ""I could not like Emma herself. Anya Taylor-Joy was miscast, in my opinion. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it was her unusual eyes? I know I disliked her hairstyles intensely. Horrid! I couldn't connect with her character."", ""I thought some of the characters were wishy washy. You would not know that Emma's sister Isabella is married to Mr Knightly's brother John. Or perhaps I blinked & missed it? Jane Fairfax was fairly insipid & there was not much to indicate that Frank Churchill was a bit of a cad weaving elaborate lies. Bill Nighy's Mr Woodhouse was too childish & effeminate for my liking. Mr Knightly, whilst likeable, was a bit childish for his age & station & not a match for this particular Emma & I could picture her walking all over him."", ""The actors I did enjoy were the characters of Mrs Weston, Harriet Smith & Miss Bates, played by Gemma Whelan, Mia Goth & Miranda Hart. Gemma Whelan of Game of Thrones fame, handled Mrs Weston with dignity & grace. Harriet was delightful & suitably innocent & gullible. My favourite character in this adaption was Miranda Hart's portrayal of the unfortunate Miss Bates. Miranda is an expert at playing socially awkward characters & did not disappoint with Miss Bates. Her embarrassment & vulnerability at Emma's spiteful words at the picnic brought me to tears. As did her graciousness in accepting Emma's attempt at an apology. Bravo Miranda!"", 'So there were some redeeming scenes throughout the movie. But overall, it fell short of my expectations & the 1996 version of Emma remains my favourite to date.', 'My Review- Emma\nMy Rating 6.9', 'Before she began the novel,Jane Austen wrote, ""I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.""\nEmma is spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people\'s lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray plus she is an awful snob.\nThis was the last of Jane Austen\'s novels to be published and completed in her lifetime.\nHer last novel Persuasion was published posthumously after her death in 1817.', 'This 2020 film version of Emma stars Anya Taylor-Joy as Emma Woodhouse and she is very good as the snobby control freak who is trying to play matchmaker to her friend Harriet Smith also played very well by Mia Goth.\nThe standout performance for me in this movie is Miranda Hart as Miss Bates as the kind hearted but overbearingly boring twittering Village spinster. Miranda Hart gives the character humour and colour and her performance is worth the price of seeing this good film.\nThe male characters in this predominantly female dominated story apart from Bill Nighy as the eccentric and delightfully self obsessed humorous father of Emma and Josh O\'Connor as Mr Elton The Village Vicar seemed to lightweight to me .\nThe two romantic leads lacked charm and sex appeal to me Johnny Flynn as George Knightley looked a little scruffy and more suited to the role of Mr Robert Martin the good hearted farmer .Callum Turner also seemed lacking to me in his role as Frank Churchill the charming but deceitful potential suitor of Emma.\nPerhaps that was the intention of Autumn de Wilde another impressive female director to avoid well known male stars from stealing the limelight from the\nimpressive women?\nTop 10/10 marks to the Production personnel on this version of Emma it\'s a joy to watch the Cinematography by Christopher Blauvelt ,Production Designer Kate Quinn, Art Director Alice Sutton, Set Director , Stella Fox (who did ""Judy"" Star Wars Episode V11,) and especially Costume Designer ,Alexandra Byrne ( Phantom of the Opera and Mary Queen of Scots) who should be nominated next year for an Oscar.', 'If you love the World of Jane Austen the frippery and foppery and that long lost past age of strict manners and snobbery of Georgian Society you\'re sure to love Emma .\nI couldn\'t help comparing Emma to the other recent period film set 60 years ahead in America Greta Gerwig\'s stunning version of ""Little Women"" with a character Jo March also not looking for marriage but with more a woman of substance than Emma.', 'What an amazing remake, Jane Austen would have been proud! I think this is the best and most humorous version of ""Emma"". The timing and the sublime jokes. I laughed out loud constantly- as did the rest of the cinema audience. Bill Nighy as Mr Woodhouse alone is worth the ticket!', ""I'm a HUGE fan of Emma so I went and saw this the first chance I had (after what felt like an agonizingly long wait). I was not in any way disappointed."", ""Like all of the other adaptions, De Wilde's version has its own unique charms. I don't need a 'definitive' version; as far as I'm concerned, the more of them the better as long as they each have something to offer - I'll watch them all, again and again. This was one offers quite a lot. I can think of a number of scenes that I can't wait to see again - scenes that are faithful to the story we already know and love but are not like what we have seen onscreen already."", ""I have a few small nitpicks - several lines that were rushed/not given their full emotional weight; Mr. Woodhouse's bouncy energy; Mr. Knightley's a little too young (but the performance was fantastic); Emma being perhaps a little too cold; the pivotal romantic scene near the end was just not quite right, not quite strong enough - but nothing that would prevent me from giving it a 10/10."", ""It's a funnier movie than the trailer suggests. I thought a lot of the jokes in the trailer fell a little flat but they fit much better into the movie itself and there were some other quite funny new moments."", ""I don't think any fans of Emma should have any reservations about seeing this one."", 'I love costume movies and Swarovski jewellery in this movie. Like the story I think Johnny Flynn was very good,remember him from the "" Beast""', ""Not really sure why we need another film adaption of this novel when they're already a few better versions out there.

One of the most painfully inauthentic and unintentionally funny scenes is when Bart runs around repeating the words ""Oh my God! Oh my God!"" over and over.

Ayanna and Isaiah have a ""meet cute"" at a park which feels real, and it\'s heartwarming to watch their romance blossom as they get to know each other. Their sex scene is very beautifully shot and more sensual than sexual. The real meat of the story doesn\'t take place, though, until roughly 45 minutes into the film when Ayanna gets pregnant and doesn\'t tell Isaiah. There\'s a very moving scene when her mother suspects that she\'s pregnant as they sit in the kitchen and Ayanna goes to the fridge as she announces that she\'s hungry for some pickles. Just like her relationship with Isaiah, her relationship with her mother feels just as true-to-life. The screenplay could\'ve used a little but more comic relief, but that\'s forgivable. At least there\'s not a single scene that\'s contrived, cheesy or melodramatic. Green and Howard avoid the use of narration, and they trust the audience\'s emotions, patience, intelligence and imagination for the most part, especially during the third act that\'s satisfying without tying everything in a near bow.', ' ', "" &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Zora Howard gives a breakthrough performance as Ayanna.

Emma sets her sights on matching her next young friend Harriett with a suitably successful man. Emma is convinced that Harriett should marry above her station. Since Harriett looks up to the charming Miss Woodhouse so much, she is willing to follow whatever advice she is given despite it being against her own feelings. Harriett is smitten with a local farmer, but Emma insists that she should be with another. Meanwhile, ', ' as the smart Mr. Knightly can see what the matchmaker is up to and is skeptical of her meddling. When all of these characters and more contrive to match up in various ways, comedically emotional problems ensue.', 'Of course, Jane Austen stories are well worn classics.

But in things like ', ' and ', ' the stakes feel a little more dramatic. This story has always had a playfulness to it. And this movie version reflects that light touch. Whether it’s the senior Mr. Woodhouse making a fuss over possible imagined drafts throughout his house or Emma being stuck at an overly dull tea engagement with boorish company, the focus here is always to keep things fun. Even when emotional stakes ramp up in the third act when Emma has to pay the price of her meddling, the story beats are happily lightened. For instance, in the middle of another character’s emotional confession, our heroine sprouts a surprise nosebleed that undercuts the tension.', 'There have been terrific film versions of this tale before.

It’s as if de Wilde is letting us know that what’s private as well as what’s publicly expressed in these characters is on her mind.', ' ', 'So by the time Emma takes up her campaign to pair docile, naive new friend Harriet (Mia Goth) with theatrical vicar Mr. Elton (a preeningly amusing Josh O’Connor), all while wittily sparring about meddling and morality with Mr. Knightley and playing it cool about her own prospects with rakish heir Frank Churchill (Callum Turner), the movie has carved its own stimulating, subtext-laden air of folly-ridden matchplay. It revels not only in the well-embroidered emotions that have made the novel a romcom prototype, but also the darker undercurrents that Austen was always attuned to in exploring the pitfalls of youthful overconfidence and cavalier manipulation: loneliness, anger, shame and anxiety.', 'Screenwriter Catton, whose Man Booker prize-winning epic novel “The Luminaries” is a marvel of form, setting, history, humor and mystery, has not surprisingly done right by Austen’s robust blend of storytelling, humanity and comedy.', 'Taylor-Joy’s strengths are very much in being the anti-Gwyneth here: Her Emma is more haughty and headstrong than sunlit and savvy, closer to the heroine Austen always believed she’d like more than readers would. But that, of course, makes the cracks in her veneer, when Taylor-Joy artfully reveals them, that much more attractive as a cathartic maturity.', ' ', 'Flynn, meanwhile, his appearance like an ill-at-ease rock frontman while conveying equal parts playfulness, mindfulness, and vulnerability, is a revelation, as fun as it’s ever been to watch a pining hopeful’s words say one thing while the eyes and actions communicate something else.

The overall picture is nicely rounded out by Rupert Graves and Gemma Whelan as the newly married Mr. and Mrs. Weston, Amber Anderson as Emma’s less-well-off rival Jane Fairfax, and, as a late-introduced woman of awkward social graces, a pitch-perfect Tanya Reynolds.', 'With Alexandra Byrne’s intricate, season-sensitive costumes adding their own liveliness to the visual splendor, and a music score deftly combining traditional folk, classical snippets, and original character motifs from Isobel Waller-Bridge (yes, Phoebe’s sister) and David Schweitzer, the technical achievements on display are as considerable as de Wilde’s smart handling of such popular and well-traveled material. Mr. Woodhouse’s daughter may be a case study in the perils of playing God with others’ hearts, but “Emma.” is proof that bringing a timeless book and fresh talent together is still a worthy kind of artistic matchmaking.', 'Take a look at which films directed or co-directed by women are on this list, unadjusted for inflation.

A light comedy neither broad enough to be farce nor pointed enough to be satire, the novel lends itself to interpretation as both, given the narrative’s manifold romantic misunderstandings and host of kooky, idle gentry. Without departing far from the text, director Autumn de Wilde’s lively new film adaptation emphasizes the more farcical elements of Austen’s second-longest novel, granting it a snappy, rhythmic pace.', 'The eponymous gentlewoman, the story’s only three-dimensional character, is played with impressive depth by Anya Taylor-Joy here. On screen, Emma can seem frivolous right up until the climactic moment that forces her into a self-confrontation, but Taylor-Joy’s open, expressive face, so often in close-up, captures Emma’s creeping uncertainty regarding her powers of judgment, as well as her own feelings, even as she continues to act the social butterfly. She’s aided by a screenplay by Eleanor Catton that doesn’t quite resolve the story’s main fault—its concluding romance counts as perhaps the least convincing of any of Austen’s works—but which preserves much of the complexity of its “handsome, clever, and rich” heroine, who must learn to abide by her judgment rather than her vanity.', 'Emma begins the film at the height of self-regard, the reigning socialite of the small countryside community of Highbury. The 20-year-old has recently made a match for her governess, Miss Taylor (Gemma Whelan), arranging her marriage—well above her station—to the neighboring widower gentleman Mr. Weston (Rupert Graves). She elects Harriet Smith (Mia Goth), a recently arrived schoolgirl of uncertain origins and inelegant manners, to be her next project. She teaches the naïve girl, enraptured by Emma’s ostentatious wealth and delicate bearing, to present herself as worthy of a genteel suitor, manipulating her into rejecting the proposal of hardy local farmer Mr. Martin (Connor Swindells), and encouraging her to pursue the affections of the young vicar-about-town Mr. Elton (Josh O’Connor) instead.', 'O’Connor plays Mr. Elton with palpable smarm, wearing a perpetual shit-eating grin above the ridiculous splayed-out collar of an early-19th-century Anglican vicar. Here, as elsewhere, de Wilde communicates much of what remains implicit in the novel (like Mr. Elton’s odiousness) via a tidy mise-en-scène redolent of Wes Anderson. The sterile pastels of the elegant clothing and the precise movements of both the aristocracy and their servants (who hover about in the background like strange automatons) give the film’s sudden eruptions of human neuroses a droll, punchy tone—as when Mr. Elton casually mentions that it may snow, and a dinner party suddenly erupts into chaos, the nervous guests rushing to the carriages to get back home.', 'It’s in one of those carriages that, in a scene played perhaps a bit too broadly, a slightly drunk Mr. Elton confronts Emma with the revelation that he’s been aiming to court her. Naturally, the news of Mr. Elton’s true affections devastates Harriet, whom Emma very belatedly realizes may have been well suited to Mr. Martin, though at this point Harriet has learned to think of the farmer as beneath her. Outraged at Emma’s tutoring of Harriet in the ways of class presumption is Martin’s landlord, Mr. Knightley (Johnny Flynn), a wealthy Highbury bachelor who, as brother to her brother-in-law, counts as family to Emma and her worry-wart father, Mr. Woodhouse (Bill Nighy). In the lavishly decorated living rooms and salons of their immense estates, Emma and Mr. Knightley bicker in the way that unwitting lovers in Austen tend to, arguing verbosely about the propriety of introducing Harriet to high society.', 'Emma and Knightley later have occasion to debate the relative virtues of Frank Churchill (Callum Turner) and Jane Fairfax (Amber Anderson), who arrive separately in town under much whispered ballyhoo. The young and handsome Frank seems destined to ask for Emma’s hand; Jane, the orphaned niece of local gossip Miss Bates (Miranda Hart), is rumored to be heartbroken after forming an inappropriate attachment to her adopted sister’s husband. Emma is as flattered by Frank’s attentions as she is jealous of Jane’s level of gentlewomanly accomplishment. Catton and de Wilde extrapolate from the novel’s succession of social scenarios to make Emma’s doubt about the shifting social field more comically apparent: One of the funniest scenes has the ostensibly modest Jane follow up Emma’s dilettantish performance on the pianoforte with a beautiful, complex sonata, in front of the whole town.', 'Emma’s discomfort in her new situation will come to a head when she, with Frank’s encouragement, grossly abuses her privilege as a gentlewoman with a practiced wit, embarrassing herself and wounding an old friend. ', ' is interested in such textures of early-19th-century society, if not in the latter’s pace. The film fits so much of Austen’s narrative in by judiciously condensing scenes to suit its more ironic tone, occasionally using transitional smash cuts to get right to the point. The result is a stylish, eminently watchable farce that, despite its old-England trappings, is every bit an update as it is an adaptation.', ' ', ' Anya Taylor-Joy, Johnny Flynn, Bill Nighy, Mia Goth, Miranda Hart, Josh O’Connor, Callum Turner, Rupert Graves, Amber Anderson ', ' Autumn de Wilde ', ' Eleanor Catton ', ' Focus Features ', ' 125 min ', ' PG ', ' 2020 ', ' ', ', ', 'Interview: Corneliu Porumboiu on ', ' and Playing with Genre', 'Review: ', ' Is a Chilly Rumination on Memory', 'Review: ', ' Doesn’t Elevate Itself Above Its Rote Characterizations', 'Review: ', ' Is a Fuzzy Portrait of Intersecting Lives', 'Review: Luca Guadagnino’s ', ' Remake on Lionsgate Blu-ray', 'Its portrait of Hong Kong bears more than a passing resemblance to Wong Kar-wai and Christopher Doyle’s early work.', 'Published', 'on', 'By', 'he title of Fruit Chan’s ', ' cheekily references a phrase you might have seen printed on the packaging for an action figure way back in 1997, the year of the film’s original release. But it also refers to the young, wannabe triad member with the unlikely name of Autumn Moon (Sam Lee), as well as to the production circumstances of the film itself. Its declarative label is somewhat excessive, though, as there’s no mistaking where and when Moon’s misadventures take place: Chan’s quirky, gangster-adjacent flick, so infused with washed-out and blue-filtered imagery, presents a portrait of Hong Kong that bears more than a passing resemblance to Wong Kar-wai and Christopher Doyle’s early collaborations.', 'From its handheld shots racing through open-air markets, to its use of expressionistic step-printed slow motion, to the way its perspectives on the city take inspiration from the cramped geometry of tiny Hong Kong flats, ', ' owes a lot to Wong’s breakout work. The content and structure of the story, too, is reminiscent of ', ' and ', '. Moon, a youthful and essentially innocent small-time loan shark, narrates his chance encounters and near-misses in the city in a naïve, contemplative voiceover. Although there’s no lack of plot, the film is as much about milieu as it is about events; its rather loose cause-and-effect sequence allows it to soak in the atmosphere of Moon’s subjective world.', 'The threads of the story weave in and out of each other in an almost desultory manner. Moon and his buddy Sylvester (Wenders Li, performing a broad, offensive caricature of an intellectually disabled gangster) discover the bloodied suicide letters of a teen girl named Susan (Amy Tam Ka-Chuen) and must deliver them to their intended recipients. The pair encounter Ping (Neiky Hui-Chi Yim), the daughter of one of the debtors they’re meant to shake down, and Moon promptly falls in lust, creating a conflict of interest with his mob boss, Brother Wing (Sang Chan). After discovering his father has absconded with a mistress, Moon periodically arms himself with a meat cleaver, vowing to avenge this betrayal of his mother (Doris Yan-Wah Chow), even if she doesn’t seem to care very much. She dissuades him at first, and after he resumes the quest later, he’s given pause when, en route to take out his dad, he witnesses another son dismembering a father in a restroom stall.', 'Throughout Chan’s film, comic irreverence intermingles with cosmic coincidences—shades again of the Hong Kong we know from ', '. If ', ' faces reasonable charges of derivativeness, it doesn’t help that the beautiful Ping—who turns out to be dying of renal failure and in desperate need of both cash and a set of kidneys—sports Faye Wong’s iconic pixie cut from the former film. (Ping, never much of a character in her own right, might be described as a depressive pixie-cut dream girl.)', 'Still, it’s difficult not to get caught up in the film’s frantic tour through Hong Kong—and through Moon’s juvenile head space. An inveterate wet-dreamer whose daily morning routine involves rinsing out his underpants, Moon tells us about his distinctly un-erotic, cum-centric fantasies, to which we’re also given visual access: shooting ejaculate at the low-flying airplanes that perpetually pass over Hong Kong’s urban mass, or, in another recurring dream, imagining the blood running from under Susan’s mangled corpse transforming into milk-white liquid. All of Hong Kong seems little more than some version of Moon’s dreamworld, but reality is encroaching, in the form of death. As Moon says the last time he dreams of Susan, “There were tears on my face instead of cum—were they Susan’s?”', 'This line’s mixture of crassness and melodrama lands, but overall, ', ' doesn’t successfully execute its pivot from the irreverent to the sincere, once things get serious for Moon. With its quick cuts and frenetic camerawork, it succeeds in capturing the pounding exuberance of being young in an urban environment—as in ', ' and Godard’s ', ', surely other reference points for Chan, some of the film’s best shots are just its misfit characters running in spaces they should know better than to run in—but it doesn’t manage to fuse this rebellious energy with the Wong-ian wistfulness it evidently aims for.', ' ', ' Sam Lee, Neiky Hui-Chi Yim, Wenders Li, Amy Tam Ka-Chuen, Sang Chan, Doris Yan-Wah Chow ', ' Fruit Chan ', ' Fruit Chan ', ' Metrograph Pictures ', ' 109 min ', ' NR ', ' 1997', 'So many grandiose tactics portend a grander revelation than the film’s otherwise low-key three-hander delivers.', 'Published', 'on', 'By', 'riter-director William Nicholson’s ', ' dutifully but monotonously traces the dissolution of a nearly 30-year marriage. Where the garrulous, headstrong Grace (Annette Bening) finds herself still fighting to save the relationship despite her constant disappointment, Edward (Bill Nighy) is tightly wound, reserved, and seemingly content to quell arguments, his irresponsiveness only further permitting a build-up of resentment. Their bickering appears to be a daily routine, with almost every one of their fights cut short by Edward leaving the room. But Nicholson’s script fails to give either of them much specificity beyond their polar-opposite behaviors. They’re more archetypes of a feuding couple than flesh-and-blood people who were in love with one another at some point in their lives.', 'Nicholson’s failure to probe Grace and Edward’s interior landscapes, or even get at the root problems of their marriage, only makes the film’s attempts at big emotional gestures feel all the more hollow. Indeed, both are so thinly conceived that we learn virtually all we will about them by the time they split a half hour into the film. The arrival of their twentysomething son, Jamie (Josh O’Connor), throws a potentially interesting kink into the mix, especially when it’s revealed that Edward requested his son’s presence so that someone could help him cushion the emotional blow of Grace being told that he’s leaving her. But rather than explore the dysfunctional context of this father-son relationship and whatever led up to such a callous, manipulative decision, Nicholson settles for propping Jamie as the helpless middleman between his mother, who refuses to accept that her marriage is over, and his father, who quickly absconds to shack up with his mistress, Angela (Sally Rogers).', 'Nicholson adapted ', ' from his own 1999 play ', ', and its stagebound origins are apparent throughout. While Bening brings an underlying warmth to her role that could easily have been simplistically shrill in another actor’s hands, the other performers are more visibly constrained by the flimsy characterizations offered to them. Any signs of the spontaneous messiness, rage, and sorrow that accompanies most divorces are smoothed over by dialogue that’s so precisely phrased that it’s rendered listless. All the while, the filmmaking exudes the generic sheen of prestige picture, especially across the long, sweeping drone shots of the cliffside U.K. town of Seaford, where the film is set.', 'For being so disconnected from the drama at hand, the panoramic beauty of those interludes is as jarring as the voiceovers of Grace quoting John Keats’s poems and Edward laboriously recounting tales of soldiers who leave the wounded behind in order to assure their own survival. All are grandiose tactics that portend a grander revelation than the film’s otherwise low-key three-hander delivers. But most damning is the shortage of quotidian details that might have given us a richer sense of the lives lived and marriage lost in this patch of the world.

There ', ' evil in the world, of course. More specifically, there’s evil in a nation that forces its young men to enlist in military service that may require them to execute their fellow citizens. There’s evil in choosing between killing just one person or many, and in killing some so that one can love others. There’s evil in bureaucracy, in family secrets, in selective rectitude. And there’s evil in selfish refusals masquerading as ethical stances.', 'In fact, for Rasoulof, evil seems to be the most significant organizing force of daily life—the evil of past actions, present decisions, and atemporal structures—in a culture such as Iran’s that accepts murder as a legitimate form of punishment. ', ', then, doesn’t try to facetiously dispel the statement that its title makes by asking whether or not evil exists. It ponders, instead, how citizen’s position themselves in relationship to the inevitable evil that runs through their country’s core, architecting its every corner and generations of people.', 'Each section of the film is independently titled and abides by a different genre, and as such could function as a standalone short. The first is arguably the strongest because we’re still oblivious to the games Rasoulof may want to play with us. The filmmaker masterfully plays off of our ignorance, spending almost the entirety of the segment making us believe in a realistic portrait of the everyday life of a perfectly happy, and drama-free, middle-class family in Iran, saving one of the most unexpected plot twists in all of cinema to the very last shot.', 'In retrospect, Heshmat’s (Ehsan Mirhosseini) life should have been too good to be true. When we first meet him, he’s playing the neighborhood hero, saving a kitten stuck in a hole. He then patiently listens to his wife’s (Shahi Jila) infinite list of mundane complaints as he drives, in a lengthy sequence that recalls Abbas Kiarostami’s ', '. We also see Heshmat vacuum his elderly mother’s entire apartment, tenderly dye his wife’s hair after helping her pick out the right color, and being an example of honesty at the local grocery store. It isn’t until we’ve grown completely accustomed to the idea that there is no “catch” to this portrait of family life in Iran that Rasoulof punches us in the gut with a flawlessly timed denouement.', 'The jolt is at once affective and intellectual, as you may feel as if you understand the film in an instant, as an uncompromising exposure of the banality of evil, then spend the rest of it nursing your shock. It’s clever for Rasoulof to not use the structure of the first segment, with its last-minute narrative blow, as a model for the ones that follow. Rather, ', ' takes the shape of a filmic anthology, as if multiple directors with distinct sensibilities had been asked to share their musings on the same topic: the various shapes that guilt and honor (or lack thereof) might take in a context of state-sanctioned death. Through this chameleonic approach, Rasoulof unravels the various conceptual threads that emerge from the first story with shorts that are still full of suspense and mystery but that allow us to situate ourselves much sooner, and as such participate in the drama in a more cerebral fashion.', 'In another impeccably orchestrated segment, we find a soldier, Pouya (Kaveh Ahangar), wallowing in despair as he awaits the order to execute his first prisoner. The story evokes Dostoevsky, as our reluctant hero spends the night with his barrack mates discussing the many ways he can escape his predicament, all of which seem to lead to a dead end still teeming with some fatal injustice. It’s just a question of who will end up pulling the trigger, or pushing the stool, in a world where all bodies are marked to either slay or be slayed.', 'The ending here is also shocking. Not because it suddenly illuminates a crucial blind spot in our understanding of the story, but due to its unexpected playfulness. The idea of captive life already being a kind of death takes shape through a sudden genre transition when the film surrenders to the lightheartedness of a musical. As reunited lovers sing the Italian resistance song “Bella Ciao” in a getaway car in a moment of ecstatic euphoria, the taste of freedom becomes the only experience worth seeking—whatever the cost, and however brief.', ' ', ' Baran Rasoulof, Shahi Jila, Kaveh Ahangar, Darya Moghbeli, Shaghayegh Shoorian, Mahtab Servati, Mohammad Valizadegan, Ehsan Mirhosseini, Alireza Zareparast, Mohammad Seddighimehr, Salar Khamseh, Reza Bahrami, Pouya Mehri, Kaveh Ebrahim ', ' Mohammad Rasoulof ', ' Mohammad Rasoulof ', ' 150 min ', ' NR ', ' 2020', 'The film allows that we are complicit in privilege for our fascination and envy.', 'Published', 'on', 'By', 'iven the current polarization of political discourse, it’s become easy for filmmakers to satirize the rich as monsters.

What’s missing from the fashionable preaching of these productions (partially exempting ', ') is wickedness, a sense that we’re learning something we didn’t already know, or are perhaps forging a risky kinship with characters who should theoretically repel us. In this context, ', ' offers a naughty thrill, as director Giuseppe Capotondi and screenwriter Scott B. Smith establish an atmosphere of rarefied debauchery, which they allow to hang in the air for a surprisingly extended amount of time, until springing a rushed third act.', 'Adapted from Charles Willeford’s novel of the same name, ', ' is a form of revenge exacted upon critics. In Milan, an art critic, James Figueras (Claes Bang), delivers a lecture, promoting a book he’s written tellingly called ', '. James discusses a primitive-looking yet bold painting involving yellows and slashing gestures, which he initially writes off before switching gears with an elaborate story of loss that inspired the artist to create it. After this tale, the audience is ready to buy prints of the work, until James confesses that he’s lying; he himself painted it thoughtlessly. James has asserted his power as a critic, as a conveyor of meaning, to arouse interest in something without value.', 'This scene is intercut with moments in which James practices his lecture in a bathroom, a device that emphasizes the contrivance of his performance. James, then, has broken a cardinal rule of criticism that many critics are tempted to violate: to not dictate the terms of art-making. James’s elitism is so pronounced that he feels that virtually no one can tell the difference between “real” and “fake” art, and so he will take it upon himself to dictate reality in order to sell his writing and perhaps future derivative paintings, which he can render “good” through the power of his erudition, rationalizing, and gift for myth-making. James is a frustrated creative, like Lee Israel in Marielle Heller’s ', ', who illustrates the potentially murky boundary separating the politics of the art industry from fraudulence. James has come to utilize notions of reputation and canon, which are complicated and dependent on class and power anyway, as bolsters of an elaborate shell game.', 'Bang is at ease with James’s un-likeability—and his confidence is among ', '’s most reliable pleasures. As in BBC’s recent, uneven ', ' miniseries, Bang emits here an aura of boredom, intelligence, and mild amusement that could mask an abyss of cruelty; his handsomeness and peerless diction are subtly menacing. As such, we feel protective of Berenice Hollis (Elizabeth Debecki), a young woman who meets James at this lecture and quickly sleeps with him. Berenice also presents herself as tough, but Debecki allows you to feel Berenice’s effort, there’s nothing of James’s bitterness in her. Soon, they’re in Lake Como at the sprawling country home of art gallery owner Joseph Cassidy (Mick Jagger), where James could land the assignment of a lifetime: an exclusive interview with reclusive artist Jerome Debney (Donald Sutherland), a man of mystery who lives in a studio on Joseph’s estate. Joseph wants James to wrangle from the old man something he can sell.', 'Capotondi and Smith don’t allow this mother lode of backstory to overwhelm the film, as they whittle it down to a series of verbal duels, in which James, Joseph, and Jerome debate the semantics of art and art-creation against the gorgeous backdrop of Joseph’s estate. ', ', the title of which is a despairing parody of critical pretension, is essentially a sun-dappled essay on male egocentrism. And, unlike many recent greed parables, it bothers to empathize with the draw of wielding power, of keeping the company of gorgeous and charismatic young women, and of walking into a room knowing everyone inside wants what you have. In other words, the film allows that we are complicit in privilege for our fascination and envy, and Jagger’s stunt casting opposite of Bang is an especial masterstroke.', 'Jagger is, of course, far more successful than even his character, and here he radiates an effortless cynicism and self-satisfaction, barely papered over with courtesy, which is deeply amusing and resonant. Joseph is a commanding, charismatic embodiment of privilege, and Jagger’s svelte wielding of his own legend-hood serves to put the comparatively unknown Bang up on his figurative haunches, a relationship between actors which embodies viscerally the relationship between their characters. James is a wannabe, whereas Joseph is a player.', 'Sutherland offers the audience a reprieve from the film’s central big-dick contest, giving Jerome a courtly decency that testifies to the optimism that can drive artistic creation, which can get lost among the politics of distribution, accumulation, and analysis. The truth of Jerome’s current artistic output isn’t a surprise, and it leads to acts of violence that are common of thrillers, somewhat compromising the film’s lingering, mysterious air of possibility. This routine plotting is a disappointment coming from Smith, who wrote the novel ', ' as well as its screenplay adaptation, both of which tracked terrifyingly plausible descents into violence. However, ', ' ends on a lovely, bittersweet note, in which a piece of art finds an audience of one, who regards it with nothing more or less than the piercing human love that led to its very creation.', ' ', ' Claes Bang, Elizabeth Debicki, Mick Jagger, Donald Sutherland, Rosalind Halstead, Alessandro Fabrizi ', ' Giuseppe Capotondi ', ' Scott B.

On the occasion of the film’s release, join us in revisiting the Pixar canon, ranked from worst to best. ', 'The effect of the ', ' films is practically primal. They appeal to anyone who’s ever cared about a toy—one they outgrew, gave away, or painfully left behind somewhere. These films, with scant manipulation and much visual and comic invention, thrive on giving toys a conscience and imagining what adventures they have when we turn our backs to them. Conversely, the effect of ', ' and its infinitely ', ', toons about dudes-as-cars not quite coping with their enormous egos and their contentious bromances, is entirely craven in the way it humorlessly, unimaginatively, and uncritically enshrines the sort of capitalist-driven desires Pixar’s youngest target audience is unable to relate to. Unless, that is, they had a douchebag older brother in the family who spent most of his childhood speaking in funny accents and hoarding his piggy-bank money to buy his first hot rod. ', 'Maybe it’s my general aversion to Nascar, or anything chiefly targeted at below-the-line states. Maybe it’s that Larry the Cable Guy’s Mater is the Jar Jar Binks of animated film. Or maybe it’s just that a routinely plotted movie about talking cars is miles beneath Pixar’s proven level of ingenuity, not to mention artistry (okay, we’ll give those handsome heartland vistas a pass). Whatever the coffin nail, ', ', if not its utterly needless sequel, is thus far the tepid, petroleum-burning nadir of the Pixar brand, the first of the studio’s films to feel like it’s not just catering, but kowtowing, to a specific demographic. Having undeservedly spawned more merchandising than a movie that’s literally about toys, ', '’s cold commercialism can still be felt today, with a just-launched theme park at Disneyland. And while CG people are hardly needed to give a Pixar film humanity, it’s perhaps telling that this, one of the animation house’s few fully anthropomorphic efforts, is also its least humane. ', ' has poignant moments, particularly when a human boy teaches Arlo, the titular protagonist, how to swim in a river, and there are funny allusions to how pitiless animals in the wild can be. But the film abounds in routine, featherweight episodes that allow the hero to predictably prove his salt to his family, resembling a cross between ', ' and ', '. There’s barely a villain, little ambiguity, and essentially no stakes. There isn’t much of a hero either. Arlo is a collection of insecurities that have been calculatedly assembled so as to teach children the usual lessons about bravery, loyalty, and self-sufficiency. ', ' is the sort of bland holiday time-killer that exhausted parents might describe as “cute” as a way of evading their indifference to it. Children might not settle for it either, and one shouldn’t encourage them to. ', 'It’s perfectly fair to walk into ', ' with a wince, wondering what ', ' hath wrought, and lamenting the fact that even Pixar has fallen into Hollywood’s post-recession safe zone of sequel mania and brand identification. What’s ostensibly worse, ', ' jumps on the prequel, origin-story bandwagon, suggesting our sacred CGI dream machine has even been touched by—gulp—the superhero phenomenon. But, while admittedly low on the Pixar totem pole, ', ' proves a vibrant and compassionate precursor to ', ', the kid-friendly film that, to boot, helped to quell bedroom fears. Tracing Mike and Sulley’s paths from ill-matched peers to super scarers, ', ' boasts Pixar’s trademark attention to detail (right down to abstract modern sculptures on the quad), and it manages to bring freshness to the underdog tale, which is next to impossible these days. ', ' is content to explore the end of Lightning McQueen’s (Owen Wilson) career with a series of pre-packaged sports-film clichés—an old dog trying to learn new tricks, struggling with a sport that seems to have passed him by, and facing, for the first time in his career, a sense of vulnerability. The template turns out to be a natural fit for the ', ' universe, organically integrating racing into the fabric of the film and rendering it with a visceral sense of speed, excitement, and struggle. Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo) is a welcome addition, a plucky foil to McQueen who’s also a three-dimensional presence in her own right, much more richly developed than one-joke characters like Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) and Luigi (Tony Shalhoub). Cruz’s presence also allows the filmmakers to bring some social conscience to this sometimes backward-looking franchise, exploring the discouraging pressures placed on young female athletes while also nodding toward the historical exclusion of women and racial minorities from racing. ', 'For those who waited patiently for the first Pixar film to be led by a female protagonist, it’s understandable that ', ' might have been a disappointment, arriving after the studio hit its artistic peak, and suffering from a handful of authorship woes. But the feminist fable remains the most underrated of this revered brand’s lot, not least because of Princess Merida’s eye-popping head full of aptly unruly hair. The movie may enchant with its focus on Scottish lore (an element arguably explored better in ', '), and it may deserve a hand for its girl-power, who-needs-a-husband trajectory, but the distincitve bit that puts the lump in your throat is the mother-daughter story. From ', ' to ', ', ', ' to ', ', princess tales almost always deal with the heroine’s link to a father or an evil mother surrogate, never an actual mom who imposes relatable, resonant rules. This far more interesting dichotomy gives ', ' an especially fresh and expressly female perspective. And while Merida’s mother’s transformation into a bear may seem gonzo and random, it’s actually perfectly appropriate: Together, mother and daughter must fight to undo a beast of a burden, one that’s historically, symbolically masculine in nature. ', ' doesn’t have a distinctive visual style, but it does showcase Pixar’s trademark mastery of depth, light, and shadow. As in Dan Scanlon’s ', ', the fanciful and the everyday are well harmonized. That’s still a neat trick, but it’s no more novel than Ian (Tom Holland) and Barley’s (Chris Pratt) experiences. Animated features often borrow from other films, in part to keep the grown-ups in the crowd interested, but the way ', ' recalls at various points ', ', ', ', and ', ' feels perfunctory and uninspired. And it all leads to a moral that’s at least as hoary as that of ', ' or ', '. While ', ' begins as a story of bereavement, it soon turns to celebrating the payoffs of positive thinking. That you can accomplish whatever you believe you can is a routine movie message, but it can feel magical when presented with more imagination than ', ' ever musters. ', 'The gentle counterpart to Dreamworks Animation’s ', ', ', ' deals in a wealth of familiar themes and narratives, peddling the importance of community inherent to ant populations, positioning unlikely hero Flik as a fish out of water when he seeks help for the colony, and reinforcing the tyke-targeted notion that “being small isn’t so bad” (a maxim preached to young ant Dot, voiced by a very young Hayden Panettiere). But when Flik, a “country bug,” goes searching for warriors to combat the ants’ oppressive grasshopper nemeses, and instead returns with a ragtag troupe of circus insects (think the gang from ', ' performing amid the carnival debris of ', '), a more intriguing theme emerges. As the actors and acrobats help the ants to craft a massive bird (a salvation-bringing idol that will hopefully scare off the enemy), they also introduce art as an alternative to fear and violence, and the film presents entertainment as something not just diverting, but heroic. ', 'Driven by the potency of its social intentions, Eliza Hittman’s film is so authentically felt that it becomes hyper-real.', 'Published', 'on', 'By', 'liza Hittman’s ', ', a slice of life in a neorealist vein, is a bravura depiction of the social barriers that get in the way of women asserting their agency. Quiet and perpetually dressed in a hoodie, 17-year-old Autumn (Sidney Flanigan) is first glimpsed at her Pennsylvania high school’s ‘50s-style talent show performing a cover of the Exciters’s 1963 hit “He Got the Power,” whose lyrics include “He makes me do things I don’t want to do/He makes me say things I don’t want to say.” Between this, the barbershop quartet at the ready, and the students dressed as Elvis Presley, Hittman pointedly ironizes an ostensibly enlightened present’s nostalgia for a regressive past.', 'Autumn is increasingly detached from her family, including her mother (Sharon Van Etten). She only really connects with her cousin, Skylar (Talia Ryder), with whom she works at a grocery store where everyone, including their manager, leers at them. Soon, a pregnancy test confirms what Autumn had already suspected. We don’t know who the father is, and that doesn’t really matter. After reading a few adoption pamphlets, and trying to induce a miscarriage by brutally punching her belly, Autumn decides to have an abortion. But there’s one problem: In Pennsylvania, a parent is required to give permission for an underage person to have the procedure. And so Skylar and Autumn steal from the cash register at work and grab a Greyhound to New York together, where an abortion should be slightly easier to obtain.', 'After the bus soars past post-industrial Pennsylvania and heads into a tunnel, plunging ', ' into momentary darkness, we’re teleported to Manhattan, and the effect is nothing less than electric, redolent of the entry into the Zone from Andrei Tarkovsky’s ', '. Hélène Louvart’s 16mm cinematography never smacks of easy nostalgia, as there’s a distinctly modern quality to the grain and flattened colors of the film’s images. There’s a limber quality to the handheld camerawork, a delicacy to the way it almost seems to caress characters’ faces. As envisioned here, New York suggests an alien world, the shallow focus reducing figures on busy sidewalks to glowing shapes of various colors.', 'Plagued by setbacks, Autumn and Skylar have to stay in the city overnight, and as they have no money for a hotel, they’re forced to sleep inside bus and subway stations. It’s as if the city is turning against them, but when they find a late-night arcade, there’s a pointedness to the kaleidoscopic presentation of the scene. Here, Hittman’s sensuous filmmaking stands in sharp contrast to the harshness of the subject matter, as she neither loses sight of the miserable nature of Autumn and Skylar’s situation nor their desires for more than just security. These are two very normal girls, and their ordinariness, as they struggle to navigate spaces that are built for men to stare at women from behind one-sided mirrors, or to trap them behind a cash desk, underscores the life they can’t have. But the arcade, with its ', ' machine and Tic-Tac-Toe-playing chicken, still offers them a kind of escape.', 'Hittman’s dreamy coming-of-age stories at times suggest something from the Larry Clark school of provocation, where a certain penchant for transgression comes at the expense of verisimilitude. But the strength of this film is that its transgression comes from the shock of how the abortion system works. How each thing that ostensibly keeps people safe is harmful in a different way. Use your invaluable health insurance, and the procedure will show up on your parents’ statement. Spend the stolen cash to pay for it instead and you can’t buy a ticket home. This approach might be didactic at times, but Hittman’s screenplay manages to capture the interlocking effects of wider, separate issues with impeccable precision. Medicare for all, toxic masculinity, the working class, pro-lifers, homelessness, and privatization of public space—all are gestured to without moralizing or pontificating. It’s all in service of character.', 'The political centerpiece of the film is the scene that gives it its title, in which Autumn is made to respond to “personal questions” with the answers “never,” “rarely,” “sometimes,” or “always.” It’s then that she can go through with her abortion. All of the questions involve increasingly violent situations with men. And in one elongated close-up, the extent of Autumn’s experiences to date are painfully suggested across her face. “I want to make sure you’re safe,” says the counselor, who’s literally only looking to check the right boxes and send Autumn on her merry way. Driven by the potency of its social intentions, ', ' is so authentically felt that it becomes hyper-real, a nightmarish disquisition about how entire systems are rigged against women that would feel academic if it didn’t play out against earnest performances of tender teenage emotions.', ' ', ' Sidney Flanigan, Talia Ryder, Théodore Pellerin, Ryan Eggold, Sharon Van Etten ', ' Eliza Hittman ', ' Eliza Hittman ', ' Focus Features ', ' 101 min ', ' PG-13 ', ' 2020', 'It’s difficult to imagine a more socially engaged or powerful condemnation of the exploitative gig economy than Ken Loach’s latest.', 'Published', 'on', 'By', 't’s difficult to imagine a more socially engaged or powerful condemnation of the exploitative gig economy than Ken Loach’s ', ', which places the viewer on the ground with an English family trudging through the muck left behind by the erosion of workers’ rights in Europe. Here, the supposed economy of free choice promulgated by neoliberal policies manifests as a domestic realm in which one’s job penetrates into every waking moment, leaving stressed bodies and minds with no time and little wherewithal for a personal life or obligations. Global forces control the fate of the family at the story’s center, in ways not immediately apparent on the individual or family level. As Ricky (Kris Hitchen) plaintively puts it late in the film, “It just seems to me that everything is out of wack.”', 'The fulcrum on which Ricky’s life teeters is the small black scanner he carries with him as a delivery person for a private parcel service. The all-powerful scanner tracks the packages he rushes to destinations around his former mining town, as well as Ricky himself, keeping him synchronized to a precise delivery schedule that he can be punished severely for falling behind on. The black box itself also constitutes a symbol of his extreme employment precarity, as the company he works for (the fictional PDF) supplies him with one of the expensive machines, and he would be on the hook for a thousand pounds if it were to be broken or lost.', 'Through the device of the scanner, Loach and screenwriter Paul Laverty no doubt intentionally evoke the bicycle from Vittorio De Sica’s ', '. They revealingly suggest that the gig economy promises little more but a return to pre-prosperity conditions for Europe’s working class, sold under the pretense of expanded autonomy and opportunity. Though Ricky answers both to the black box and Maloney (Ross Brewster), an imposing, unforgiving boss, he ostensibly serves as a “franchisee,” the owner of his own business and master of his own destiny—the overt scam by which large companies like Uber circumvent labor laws and outsource the costs of operation to their employees (sorry, “independent contractors”).', ' you opens with Maloney explaining the job in such terms to Ricky, but, piece by piece, the film rends apart the image constructed by Maloney’s con-man pitch. In Loach’s unadorned, social-realist style, we see Ricky’s life begin to crumble as anxieties mount: the behavioral issues of his teenage son, Seb (Rhys Stone), are exacerbated by Ricky’s increased hours away from home; his daughter, Liza (Katie Proctor), still a tender 11 years old, suppresses the trauma of the family’s increasingly tension-filled lives; and Ricky is progressively alienated from his beloved wife, Abbie (Debbie Honeywood), whose perpetual self-sacrifice at work and home seems to be for naught. The six-day-a-week job Ricky needs to survive proves lacking in any of the flexibility that would allow him to address these compounding family crises and any of the protections that would facilitate recovery from his work-borne fatigue and the acts of God that eventually beset him.', 'The viewer accompanies Ricky on his deliveries, showing the day-to-day difficulties a courier copes with in dealing with a broad range of individuals caught up in their own world and oblivious to his. But Loach also devotes stretches of the film to other members of the family; most prominently, the film speaks to the current labor market’s degradation of human dignity through Abbie’s struggle to work while keeping her family together, stable, and healthy. Abbie cares for elderly hospice patients, making in-home visits to keep them company and assist them in moving, eating, and using the restroom—for which she’s paid a mere pittance and, like Ricky, must contend with a dehumanizing management that perpetually pushes her work hours into her family time. Through Abbie’s conversations with Mollie (Heather Wood), one of her patients and a former labor organizer, that Loach and Laverty deliver the reminder that the battles that need to be fought today have been waged before—and won.', 'The characters, each wearied by the constant stress of this economy are played with an understated realism that’s startling in the context of the typical melodrama through which poverty and social crises are usually addressed. To Loach, social problems cannot be distilled into melodrama’s abstractions, as the dignity in labor and life slipping out of the characters’ worlds stems from their material conditions, not from inner psychological states or idealist values. One could describe Loach’s depiction of the disintegration of this working-class family unit as emotionally devastating—and it absolutely is—but to leave it there would be to miss the point.

It’s a small music box, which the young man, touched by the gesture, is quick to wind so he can finally listen to what he has to say, even if by proxy.', 'It’s easy to feel as if the film’s pathos begins to slip through Tsai’s fingers as we listen to the melancholy song produced by the music box. On screen, such a memento is often used as a symbol for sorrow, and as such would appear to be at odds with the director’s penchant for ambiguity. Yet Tsai is quick to deliver us from hackneyed territory by having the young man wind the music box again and again and again, turning the prop into something else altogether.

The film’s opening shot is fixed on the electric orange curls of Undine’s (Paula Beer) hair as she sits, downcast, at an outdoor café. She’s being dumped by her wealthy boyfriend, Johannes (Jacob Matschenz), an affront that she attempts to combat with semantics. When this fails, she tells him, “If you leave me, I’ll have to kill you. You know that.” This is a succinct enough summary of the myth ', ' takes as its source text, in which a sprite is given human life after she falls in love with a man who she insists must remain faithful to her.', 'Petzold shoots that breakup in a tight shot-reverse shot sequence, emphasizing the bland, molded sympathy of Johannes and Undine’s alert, probing micro-expressions. The scene’s realism is interrupted twice: by a church bell that elicits both a tear from Undine and a slight, spectral rising of music on the soundtrack; and by the flip phone that Undine opens to reexamine a recent voicemail. As this typically compact but deceptively rich film moves along, such flashes of dislocation proliferate, undermining ', '’s seemingly contemporary setting and leaving us to wonder whether love and logic are compatible.', 'The film gambols between tones from the outset, rushing Undine, a historian who traces the expansion of Berlin over centuries, to a presentation on local architecture and then back to the café where, hoping that Johannes has changed his mind and opted to stay with her, she meets Christoph (Franz Rogowski), a goofy industrial diver who fixes bridges and dams. Their mutual relationship to both the water and industrial infrastructure is sanctified in a meet-cute involving a broken aquarium and a whispered voice from another realm.

(It’s worth noting that the café Undine returns to repeatedly is housed in an old church.) And this commentary takes the form of lectures delivered by Undine at the Senate for Urban Development and Housing, in a room dominated by scale models depicting Berlin’s sprawl over the past few centuries.', 'Her speech on the Berlin Palace, an imperial hub dating back to 1443 that was destroyed 500 years later and is currently being rebuilt to house a museum, refers to the “phantom pain of a violent amputation” that must be reclaimed in a modern context. “Progress is impossible,” she hypothesizes, but individuals and the broader public nonetheless long to make a performance of healing. This poignant speech is one of the few moments where Undine seems to obliquely reference her identity as a once- or semi-aquatic creature. Petzold’s concise narrative has plenty on its mind, but it’s challenging to reconcile the fantastic nature of his premise with the relative lack of importance it attaches to Undine’s actions or philosophy.', 'Progress, like romance, moves in cycles, and Undine’s speech augurs the return of Johannes to her psyche. Their chance meeting opens up a rupture in Christoph and Undine’s heretofore unalloyed mutual affection, and as Petzold ushers his lovers toward doom, the film almost seems to rewind, revisiting most of its settings and turning sites of passion into mausoleums of aching and regret. “Form follows function,” Undine says in one of her presentations,” and with minor alterations in framing and presentation Petzold fundamentally shifts our sense of these locations.

Then again, there was dubiousness towards Joe Wright's 2005 adaptation of 'Pride & Prejudice' and Greta Gerwig's recent adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's "", "" for the same reason, and both proved to be vital, fresh and thrilling. Certainly from the first glimpses of director Autumn de Wilde's feature debut 'Emma.', she seems to be injecting an irreverence, a wickedness and a strong stylistic approach into this new adaptation, and thankfully the promise of those glimpses proved correct. While not as revelatory an experience as Gerwig's film, this new 'Emma.' is an absolute blast.\r\n"", '\r\nAfter successfully finding a match for her governess, privileged and intelligent 21-year-old Emma (Anya Taylor-Joy, ', ') decides that she must find a man for her best friend, the pretty but timid Harriet Smith (Mia Goth, ', ', ', "").

Rather than leaning into the comfort of familiar period film tropes, the film feels immediate, modern and wonderfully theatrical, with the machinations of Emma's matchmaking realised as a kind of dance, each figure moving as if she were directing them herself. The world of nineteenth-century wealth and privilege bursts from the screen with colour and clockwork precision, somehow both consciously aesthetic and grounded in reality. It's a world of control, order, ritual and exchange, where marriage becomes a question of status and safety. For Emma, her ability to control the fates of those around her is a sport, where she can enjoy the thrill of the chase without consequence to herself.\r\n"", '\r\nFor much of the first act, de Wilde maintains a thrilling grip on the musicality of the world she is creating, and all of the cast falls into the rhythm of her dance beautifully. Her approach is not dissimilar to that used by Joe Wright in his stunning adaptation of ', "" (2012), using choreography to realise the performativity of the rich and privileged, but where Wright used it to crack open the violence of that facade to devastating effect, de Wilde does so to reveal the ridiculousness of their performance. As with much of Austen, 'Emma.' ultimately becomes a story about class, the damaging assumptions made on one's character based on background and social status, and how adherence to that hierarchy stands in the way of human happiness. For Emma, love comes secondary to a secure marriage, a philosophy that leads her away from Harriet's true affections for gentle farmer Robert Martin (Connor Swindells) and into the clutches of richer but more dismissive men. There is certainly an element to which Emma uses Harriet as a toy, but it also speaks to a deeper fear in her, one of protection and preservation. The hypochondria of her father (Billy Nighy, 'About Time') manifests in her determination that love comes secondary to self-protection, and this extends to those she loves. Her powers of manipulation are great, and lead her towards acts of incidental cruelty to those around her, but they belie a deeper panic - without the safety of money or status, the position of a woman in this world is practically non-existent, regardless of her looks or personality. That a match can be built on mutual respect and love rather than possession is a fantasy as far as she is concerned, and her arc in the film is to discover the reality of that, both for those she loves and for herself.\r\n"", ""\r\nPerhaps this is what gives de Wilde and Catton's approach such immediacy. The film is so funny, so charming, so sexy and so gorgeous, a joy for the heart and the senses (especially thanks to Christopher Blauvelt's sumptuous cinematography and Alexandra Byrne's fucking incredible costume design), but it never feels frivolous. It is underpinned by an intelligent reading of Austen's story and a respect for its subtlely complex psychology. de Wilde is also exacting in her use of the choreographed aesthetic - when the film moves out of the ballrooms and grand houses and the need to perform, the theatricality and performativity fall away and the natural beauty of the English countryside and those occupying it blossoms. As the film carefully moves forward, these two worlds begin to crash against one other, splitting Emma's apart and bombarding her with the consequences of her actions. We know that everything will come out right in the end, but de Wilde makes sure that the journey is an enriching and affecting one. It's a wonderful feat of intelligent and imaginative direction that suggests her as someone to keep an eye on in the years to come.\r\n"", ""\r\nAs our hero, Anya Taylor-Joy could not have been better cast. She takes the big eyes and delicate features that made her so empathetic in 'The Witch' and weaponises them into a delectable and fabulous bitch, with eye rolls and wicked smiles that cut you down where you stand. She's a perfect match for de Wilde's approach, fulling embracing the play and performance whilst also able to crack Emma's facade with great impact. She's paired beautifully by a giddily gorgeous Mia Goth, proving herself again as one of the most interesting and unexpected actors around, and her delicious chemistry with Johnny Flynn, who keeps Knightley from being a Mr Darcy knock-off by embracing his humour and unencumbered generosity. In fact, the whole cast is pretty much pitch-perfect, including a hilarious and heartbreaking performance from Miranda Hart as the loveably annoying Miss Bates, and another star turn from Josh O'Connor, whose bizarre decision to play Mr Elton as a 1930s-style vampire pays off in spades. An Austen adaptation rests on the strength of its ensemble, and this is one of the best, all of them relishing and revelling in the conceit of de Wilde's approach.\r\n"", ""\r\nIf you doubt the need for another Austen, let this gorgeous film change your mind. Instead of ignoring the offers made to the period film genre by great films like 'Anna Karenina' and "", "", 'Emma.' runs with them, finding a new language for approaching the great works of one of the great writers, realising her wit and humour in new and exciting ways while honouring the deep intelligence and generosity within them. I spent the entirety of Autumn de Wilde's wonderful film with the dumbest smile on my face, mixed with peals of laughter and gushing tears of joy. This is how we must approach the great classics - a celebration of what we love about them and an engagement with how they can speak to us here and now.

This version of the 1815 novel is bright and exuberant, largely thanks to the visionary eye of director Autumn de Wilde in her feature film debut and the smart, intimate, but piercingly funny script by first time screenwriter Eleanor Catton. ', ""Anya Taylor-Joy stars as the titular character Emma, the self-anointed matchmaker in town who, despite being pretty and rich, has no interest in marriage. This is a common theme in Austen's work: the strong female lead who cares naught about what is expected of her and does what she wants for herself. Emma however, veers from the mold in that - unlike Lizzie Bennet with no family money to inherit - Emma comes from high society and isn't short of prospects. She cares what the world thinks of her in every other way, ensuring her hair is perfectly curled and pinned and her clothing the latest style, but still she loathes the idea of leaving her hypochondriac father (played by the effervescent Bill Nighy in one of the film's greatest comedic roles) for a husband - though that is, by the standards of her society, the greatest achievement a woman can hope to attain."", 'The role of Emma is a complicated one: she is non-frivolous but also ridiculous in her set beliefs - and she is often too self-righteous, self-assured and selfish to watch amiably. Taylor-Joy walks the fine line of portraying Emma with earnestness ', '  hyperbole, softening her edges just when we yearn to see a glimpse of her raw underbelly. Emma finds a dear friend in Harriet Smith (Mia Goth), a beauty without brains but a heart as soft as butter left on the counter. She clings to Emma, seeking her advice on love and requiring her approval for every decision she makes.', ""The only person who seems to hold Emma accountable for anything is Mr. Knightley (Johnny Flynn), whose brother has married her sister and is often at Emma's palatial estate to check in on her and her father or else, it seems, merely to shoot the bull. When the mysterious Mr. Churchill (Callum Turner) finally makes an appearance in town, for the first time Emma throws her own heart into the mix. What she finds when she opens herself up is not what she had expected."", ""The rest of the film fits what you might find in most of Austen's stories: mismatched lovers, a ball with dancing and very light touching,  miscommunication, a really icky vicar, long walks from one estate to another, a clandestine engagement and, of course, several happily ever afters. British comedienne Miranda Hart steals laughs in every scene she graces, and Nighy, with his wink and grin delivery, is a real treat to watch lighten very old material. The film would be nothing, however, if our Emma were not every bit strong and pretty, nuanced and unflattering, and Taylor-Joy tackles the character's complexity with a naturalness that you would think she has been preparing for all her life."", 'The story itself is hardly new, but despite being over 200 years old, ""Emma."" has never felt so fresh. de Wilde\'s propensity for highlighting color and allowing our eyes to linger on the many details of the early 19th century set and wardrobe makes the two-hour runtime a sumptuous feast. Many shots have the visual appeal of a classical portrait, the camera\'s frame pausing on perfectly manicured faces, or necks contorted in unnatural positions...only to have mouths open and the moment broken by a funny word or situational joke. The duality of ""Emma."" is just this: it is proper in its depiction of life in 1800s England, each  rule of etiquette in place, but the modern rhythm and flow from scene to scene and between characters is, in the words of Jane Austen, ""handsome, clever and rich"".', 'Want all the latest on dining, fashion, travel, events, and more delivered straight to your inbox?  \nSubscribe to receive exclusive newsletters and special offers from Seattle Refined!\nEnter your email address below to receive the latest updates.'], ['\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t', 'A Movie and Television News/Commentary Site', ' is the fourth different feature film adaptation of Jane Austen’s 1815 novel to come to the big screen since ', ' was released in 1995.', 'Anya Taylor-Joy delivers a strong turn as the title character with as much screen time as the film allows her.\xa0 Much like Regina in ', ', Emma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor-Joy) is the “queen bee.”\xa0 She has no rivals.\xa0 Well, this seems like the case until she brings Miss Harriet Smith (Mia Goth) under her wings with the hope of matchmaking.\xa0 If you’ve already seen Clueless and there’s no reason here to think you haven’t, you already know what’s bound to come next.\xa0 Emma and Harriet are going to have a falling out because Emma doesn’t think Robert Martin is good enough for Harriet to marry.\xa0 Emma has her sights set on Mr. Elton (Josh O’Connor) as a match for Harriet.', 'There’s really no need to rehash the plot.\xa0 After all, this film is the gazillionth adaptation of the Jane Austen novel.\xa0 I’ll have more on this here in a few moments.\xa0 Basically, if you know what happens in ', ', you know what’s going to happen here.', 'Looming in the distance is Mr. Knightley (Johnny Flynn).\xa0 In this instance, he’s the brother of Emma’s brother-in-law.\xa0 We all know how this is going to end though.\xa0 Unless you’ve been living in a cave, of course.\xa0 All I need to say here is Paul Rudd and you know what’s going to happen.', 'Bill Nighy essentially serve’s as the film’s comic relief, Mr. Woodhouse.\xa0 There are many points in the film when he’s complaining of a draft or cool coming in.\xa0 You can’t help but chuckle before the act starts getting old.', 'In a perfect world, Alexandra Byrne would be a contender for her costume design.\xa0 However, the film is being released in February.\xa0 It’s very rare that a February release would be a contender for the Oscars but let’s keep Byrne’s design on the radar come the end of the year.\xa0 Her designs are exactly the type of clothing that tend to win Oscars.', 'Long before ', ' was released in theaters, ', ' had been adapted six times on television.\xa0 Two adaptations came following the 1995 release.\xa0 Where ', ' is a contemporary retelling, this film is more or less sticking to the book.\xa0 Obviously, you’ll see where the former is influenced by the source text.\xa0 After watching ', ', ', ' remains the perfect adaptation of the source material.\xa0 Beautiful costumes just aren’t enough.', 'DIRECTOR:\xa0 Autumn de Wilde', '\nSCREENWRITER:\xa0 Eleanor Catton', '\nCAST:\xa0 Anya Taylor-Joy, Johnny Flynn, Bill Nighy, Mia Goth, Miranda Hart, Josh O’Connor, Callum Turner, Rupert Graves, Gemma Whelan, Amber Anderson, Tanya Reynolds, Connor Swindells', 'Danielle Solzman is native of Louisville, KY, and holds a BA in Public Relations from Northern Kentucky University and a MA in Media Communications from Webster University.

Austen’s novels have lasted for a couple of hundred years because they are just that---applicable today just as much as they were in her day. Times change, of course, and circumstances may vary. But you get the drift. ', 'In', 'a film version of Austen’s novel by the same name, Emma Woodhouse is a woman gifted with too much confidence in herself. She’s only 21, spoiled, headstrong, rich. She meddles in other people’s personal lives and overestimates her matchmaking abilities. Austen described Emma as “a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.” How’s that for bad-mouthing your own leading lady? Naturally, Austen describes how difficult it is for genteel women to survive on their own in Regency England. The narrative in “Emma” turns into a comedy of manners which involves a woman’s social status, a discreet mention of her age, and the ultimate goal of snaring a man for a good and lucrative marriage.', 'Cast as Emma is the beautiful young\xa0Anya Taylor-Joy. She’s sweet, petulant, annoying, caring, meddlesome, and a busy-body. Other than that, she’s perfect! She’s also rich, pampered and headstrong. My goodness, how can one pretty little girl have so many outstanding characteristics? Her biggest trait is that she fancies herself a matchmaker in the love department. Her best friend Harriet (played by sweet, freckle-faced Mia Goth) is an impressionable young lady completely unschooled in love-making, or even how to deal with boys at all. She falls in love with everybody who passes her on the street. It’s funny and heart-breaking, but Emma tries to help her out by introducing her to the dashing Frank Churchill (the tall hunk of a high-calorie dessert named Callum Turner). How that turns out is part of this delightful, eye-pleasing movie. Everybody and everything here is gorgeous to look at through modern eyes.', 'What Emma constantly forgets involves how to take care of her own romantic needs. Stalking around for ages is George Knightly, a roguish sort of hunk who seems to buzz around all the pretty young things. But he has a particular penchant for Emma, who won’t, of course, give him the time of day. Knightly is played by British actor/musician Johnny Flynn. He has a certain charm about him that makes you believe he could rip bodices from London to Northern Ireland and get away with it with relish. He’s a new film find and has a rough, overtly sexual quality that may make the ladies gladly give up their modesty for a few minutes of ecstasy gazing into his eyes and being crushed by his powerful arms.', 'Without a doubt, this is one of the most beautifully visual films ever made. Cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt is a Renaissance painter with his camera lens. Costume designer Alexandra Byrne has created some unbelievably beautiful\xa0clothes for both the men and women that seem almost contemporary in their fashionable forms. Today we don’t dress as foppishly, but apparel as scrumptious as this may still be found in Paris and Rome. Ms. Byrne is definitely qualified to be in the Oscar® run for next year. Production design by Kave Quinn, art direction by Alice Sutton and set decoration by Stella Fox take full advantage of the existing mansions on the British landscape. The homes used are so gorgeous they make Downton Abbey’s look like a shanty.', 'The romance shown by the two leading actors will melt \xa0even the most jaded of hearts. It is so sweet, so sexy, so inducing of angina attacks that viewers will barely survive their rise in blood pressure.', 'Director Autumn de Wilde (b. 1970) is best known for her work as a commercial and portraiture photographer. She has specialized in photographing musicians and for directing music videos.

Although it has been several years since I belatedly read Austen’s novel, the movie reminds me again of how much I enjoyed its sassy young heroine and her amusing tale of romantic troubles, and it also delights me further with a number of splendid moments to be appreciated.', 'At the beginning, we see its heroine Emma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor-Joy) enjoying her latest success. Although she is one of the richest girls in her rural village, Emma is not so particularly interested in marriage for now, and she has usually paid more attention to pairing people around her including her former governess, who recently becomes the second wife of an affluent local squire mainly thanks to Emma.', 'Not long after this happy incident, another woman who may benefit from Emma’s matchmaking enters the picture. While she is young and pretty, Harriet Smith (Mia Goth) does not have much prospect as a girl without any substantial social standing, and Emma is determined to find an ideal match for Harriet as her closest friend. Although Harriet seems to be quite interested in a local farmer, Emma thinks Harriet is too good to marry that guy, and she soon embarks on pairing Harriet with Mr. Elton (Josh O’Connor), who recently comes to the village as its new vicar.', 'While it looks like things are going as well as Emma hopes, she soon finds herself conflicting with George Knightley (Johnny Flynn), a young and wealthy bachelor who does not approve much of what Emma has been doing for Harriet. In his viewpoint, Harriet is more suitable to someone not so different from her instead of a petty snob like Mr. Elton, and, as your average headstrong girl, Emma is often annoyed by Mr. Knightley’s acerbic opinion on her matchmaking affair.', 'The movie gives us a series of humorous moments which clearly convey to us how Emma is rather oblivious to the unintentional outcome of her well-meaning actions. Eventually, there comes an unpleasant moment of realization for her not long after the end of the disastrous dinner party during one winter evening, and she certainly comes to learn a hard lesson on those tricky matters of heart.', 'As Emma tries to move on after her big mistake, another change comes into her life via Frank Churchill (Callum Turner), who has been the most desirable young bachelor in the area but has frequently been unavailable as making various excuses including his rich aunt. He did not come even when his father married Emma’s former governess, but Emma has become more curious about him just like others around her, and, what do you know, she eventually encounters Mr. Churchill by coincidence when he finally comes to the village for meeting his father and others in the village.', 'In the meantime, Emma is also introduced Miss Jane Fairfax (Amber Anderson), the niece of Emma’s longtime friend Miss Bates (Miranda Hart). While she may look rather plain compared to Emma, this young lady soon distinguishes herself in front of others with her very sophisticated aspects, and it looks like she can be a good new friend to Emma, but then it later turns out that she has some inner conflict behind her calm façade.', 'And it becomes more evident that Mr. Knightley loves and cares about Emma more than he can admit on the surface. At one point, he does a significant act of kindness for saving Harriet from misery and humiliation, and that certainly touches Emma a lot, but she and Mr. Knightley still find themselves clashing with each other as usual even while sensing more of the mutual attraction between them.', 'Leisurely and cheerfully rolling its story and characters, the screenplay by Eleanor Catton deftly alternates between humor and poignancy, and director Autumn de Wilde, who made a bunch of short films before making this feature film debut of hers, did a skillful job of filling the screen with lively mood and enjoyable details including the frequent presence of servants around its main characters throughout the film. While the production design by Kave Quinn and the costume design by Alexandra Byrne look gorgeous as required, the cinematography by Christopher Blauvelt often provides us several impressive shots to be savored, and the score by Isobel Waller-Bridge and David Schweitzer effectively functions along with several chirpy songs on the soundtrack.', 'Above all, Anya Taylor-Joy, who has been one of the most promising new actresses in Hollywood since she drew our attention for the first time with “The Witch” (2015), is utterly charming in the titular role, and she is also supported well by a number of various supporting performers. While Johnny Flynn and Callum Turner are suitably cast in their respective roles, Bill Nighy is always a pleasure to watch as Emma’s fastidious father, the other substantial cast members including Mia Goth, Miranda Hart, Rupert Graves, Amber Anderson, and Josh O’Connor are also solid on the whole.', 'Overall, “Emma.” is another successful movie adaptation of Austen’s novel, which was previously adapted for the 1996 film starring Gwyneth Paltrow. For now, I cannot say whether the movie is better than the 1996 film and many other adaptations out there, but the movie delighted and entertained me enough during my viewing, and I am willing to revisit it for more enjoyment and appreciation.', 'Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Google account.\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Twitter account.\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Facebook account.\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t', 'Connecting to %s', ' ', ' ', ' ', '\n', '\n', 'This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

There’s a gleeful cheekiness when Emma is misbehaving, and yet there’s an equal measure of compassion when misadventures backfire on her. The star’s screen presence is delightful and hers is easily the most captivating portrayal of the character to date.', 'The supporting cast includes a very funny and deftly acute Bill Nighy as Emma’s mildly cantankerous father, Johnny Flynn as the respectable George Knightley and Callum Turner as the dashing Frank Churchill. They all give well-measured performances and contribute to the film’s integrity. The standout performances, however, come from Miranda Hart as the kind-hearted gossiper Miss Bates, Josh O’Connor as the awkward Mr Elton and Mia Goth as the hapless best friend Harriet. Fans of the book will know those characters and appreciate the accurate depictions, while newcomers need only know that it is a solid ensemble comprising of diverse traits and hilarious conflictions.', 'With Greta Gerwig’s ', ' recently earning high praise, the topic of strong female-driven filmmaking is hot on everyone’s lips, and ', ' furthers that discussion. And while I couldn’t agree more with the sentiment of females rising in/leading the filmmaking pack, I can’t help but think that it may be best to do so with fresh and original stories.

Sometimes, a piece of art makes you feel so comfortable, so at peace, so overjoyed to be experiencing it, that it cannot be accurately described to someone who doesn’t understand. I don’t want to conflate comfort with easy, however, or fluffy. This film is neither of those things.

Where there was once ambiguity into Emma’s actions, Catton asserts the character is the Austen equivalent of a mean girl. Taylor-Joy’s performance bears this out, playing Emma as a woman exhibiting a fair dose of white woman feminism. She explains to her love/hate foil Mr. Knightley (Johnny Flynn) that men don’t want an intelligent woman, but it’s hard believing her actions are because of society and not her own narcissism. And Taylor-Joy plays the character with a lot of mean girl cool, from the way she deigns to give a moment to resident busybody Ms. Bates (Miranda Hart, stealing the show at every turn) to her quiet manipulation of Harriet.', 'But with Catton’s treatment of Emma as a non-murderous take on ', ' Amy Dunne, the rest of the movie follows suit. Autumn de Wilde’s direction isn’t particularly inventive, especially in a landscape where period dramas have broken the rules of time period. (Great examples include ', ' and ', '.) Cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt frames Emma and her friends as if they’re living pictures, complemented by Alexandra’s Byrne exhilarating costumes. Every scene in the movie is meant to take your breath away on the level of a Sofia Coppola movie. However this formalism in pacing ends up making the two-hour runtime feel interminably long. There isn’t even the necessary spark in the dialogue that Austen is known for. The cast can wrap their tongue around everything just fine, but outside of Taylor-Joy’s snobby chic, everyone is playing this no different than a BBC production.', 'Other than Taylor-Joy, the true standout is Goth’s interpretation of Harriet Smith. Where prior versions have presented Smith as a country bumpkin or socially awkward, Goth goes for sweetness and light. With a preternaturally high voice, Goth’s Smith can’t help but smile at not just the love that’s being talked about, but the excitement in her life. She possesses such excellent comedic timing she injects some much-needed levity into her scenes. And playing opposite Taylor-Joy, the script writes their relationship as not one of manipulation, but obsessive friendship. Emma doesn’t necessarily want Harriet to find love, telling Knightley “I want to keep her with me,” but to keep Harriet on the hook believing she’s being desired so that their friendship can continue. It’s a new spin on things that, unfortunately, isn’t delved into nearly enough, losing all relevance in the third act.', ' is by no means a bad movie, just a remarkably average one. Taylor-Joy and Goth keep things afloat, as does the sumptuous costumes and production design.

But sitting on a drawing room couch, and underneath a comfy-looking blanket, the star is reflective about what a whirlwind it’s been jumping into her first comedy—and an adaptation of a beloved yet elusive literary icon.', '“My brain does this very clever thing, I think,” Taylor-Joy says, “which is it either doesn’t really let me know what’s going on or it doesn’t impress upon me the importance of a situation, because otherwise I’d be in my bathroom screaming.” Hence how she can go from getting a cold call about meeting with a first-time director for a new\xa0', '\xa0adaptation to agreeing the next day with filmmaker Autumn de Wilde that they’ll take a stab at a protagonist who’s thwarted many a previous leading lady.', '“From the second I met Autumn, it was happening,” Taylor-Joy says. “It feels like I have been kidnapped, but by the best people possible.”', 'Chief among these pleasant hijackers is de Wilde, a lifelong photographer and music videographer who sought\xa0', '\xa0Taylor-Joy to play the versatile Ms. Woodhouse.

But it’s smartly co-written by the female director and the noted novelist Eleanor Catton, who tell the story straight and don’t try to get too smart or too daring (though an opening scene has male nudity, showing us that the family-friendly film has some spice in it thanks to a female director’s desires to show us at first glance what might interest the ladies). The writers have a fine way of telling the 19th century story as it happened in the novel by making its romantic interludes seem contemporary, as they show through their edgy heroine that a woman’s independence is not tied to class or marriage.\xa0 ', 'The well-meaning but snobby and spoiled 20-year-old Anya Taylor-Joy is the film’s very funny but deluded heroine, Miss Emma Woodhouse, whose lavish     upper-class existence in the England of large estates in the 1800s is put under the microscope. The restless rich girl is not interested in marrying herself but for others is a manipulative matchmaker. She has a nasty streak, which makes her a most beguiling heroine.

The creepy vicar has designs on Emma but she shudders when she thinks of him. So despite Emma knowing that both parties desire other mates, she still persists in being their matchmaker.

This might seem like it’s an easy novel to film (perhaps a reason for so many versions), but to fully get at what Austen is saying is a different story. To have an understanding of the story as Austen wished to convey it, calls for us to at least see the subtleties underlying the novel’s satire pertaining to class structure and to be cognizant of the way we relate to others so we don’t hurt them.'], ['After mid-90s and mid-2000s explosions in adaptations of Jane Austen novels, it feels like we’re over-due for another spate of films and TV shows based on the work of the world’s most famous female author.

Mr Weston’s estranged son, Frank Churchill (Callum Turner) causes a stir by coming back to Highbury, as does Jane Fairfax (Amber Anderson) who is the much-revered niece of Miss Bates (Miranda Hart). Much romantic entanglement and confusion abounds, until everything (of course) ends up happily ever after.', 'The casting of the titular role is key in making Emma someone we won’t find completely insufferable to spend time with. We have had Gwyneth Paltrow (ahem), Kate Beckinsale and most sympathetically – Romola Garai. Now Anya Taylor-Joy takes on the role. Unfortunately and unexpectedly, Taylor-Joy is perhaps the one bum-note in the casting of this new version. She maintains a glacial coolness (which she used to great effect in ', ') until the pivotal “three dull things” moment at the Box Hill picnic, where Emma upsets Miss Bates and Knightley rightly calls her out for it. From this point on, Taylor-Joy shows much more emotion for the rest of the film, with frequent tears. While this does broadly suit her character arc, the audience needs to be given ', ' to invest in for the first two-thirds of the story and this performance keeps us too detached. There needs to be less of a black-and-white switch between the “two Emmas” and we need to see more glimpses of her humanity before that point, otherwise we become too removed from a protagonist we need to invest in.', 'The rest of the cast is very strong, however. Johnny Flynn’s casting as a scruffy blonde and mutton-chopped Knightley raised some alarm-bells (he looks more suited to the role of Mr Martin), but he actually works out much better than expected. One of ', '‘s greatest strengths is combining two favourite romance tropes – old-friends-to-lovers and enemies-to-lovers. The chemistry and banter between Knightley and Emma is key and Flynn and Taylor-Joy do a good job of pulling it off. Mia Goth is deliciously funny as Harriet, Callum Turner makes a swarthy Frank Churchill and Josh O’Connor gets to stretch his comedic muscles as Mr Elton. There were some doubts if Miranda Hart could pull off the emotional and heartbreaking side of Miss Bates, but she does well here. Much of the humour comes from Nighy as Mr Woodhouse and his constant battle with his two footmen (one of whom is played by Angus Imrie – Merlin in ', ') over cold drafts in the enormous Hartfield.', 'The production design by Kave Quinn (', ') and costume design by Alexandra Byrne (', ') is dialled up to eleven and repeat watches will certainly be spent noticing all of the details in both. de Wilde has chosen a pastel colour palette, seemingly inspired by sweet shops and the macarons that come with afternoon teas, as well as the fashion label ', ' (who she has collaborated with before) and everything is heightened to an unnatural level of colour-coordinated perfection. Occasionally brighter colours pop against the sugary-sweet dollops of pale pinks and creams, such as the gentlemen’s mustard riding jackets and the red Handmaid-style cloaks worn by the pupils at the school that Harriet attends.', 'The over-the-top score by Isobel Waller-Bridge and soundtrack full of traditional country folk songs from ', 'and', 'is another element which aids the hyper-real artifice of the film. The actors’ movements have almost been choreographed to the music, with elements of mime and physically comedic farce.

The 1996 version ', ' did it already. It is a brilliant five-star version.', 'This time they want to make it much more lightweight, featherweight almost to the point of trivial, with plenty of lowbrow daft ‘comedy’ to make it more palatable. Obviously, this is a mistake. Austen’s comedy is highbrow, clever and always point scoring. We don’t come to Emma expecting laughs. To be fair, there are laughs here, most of them from Bill Nighy as Emma’s draught-afflicted and female-afflicted dad Mr Woodhouse, and Miranda Hart as plain, poor sad old gossipy bore Miss Bates.', 'Nighy and Hart are effortlessly funny people, so worth their weight in gold (and that must be considerable as both are impressively tall). But, even so, they are at their best here is the dramatic and poignant moments. They are all towards the end of the movie, so there is a bit of a long wait.', 'The movie starts shakily. We never really understand why Emma is obsessed with making poor pathetic Harriet Smith (Mia Goth) her constant companion and best friend, though Emma’s main recreation in life is meddling and match-making, so her main joy is trying to pair Harriet Smith with the wrong man, and her main character trait seems to be for ever getting the wrong end of the stick. Here, she is as irritating and abrasive a character as Dolly Levi in ', ' – another match-maker who doesn’t want to be caught by a man.', 'This makes Emma seem a manipulative muddler and a bit of an idiot, and Anya Taylor-Joy never explains why her Emma character is worth while or worthy of our interest, let alone admiration. Her treatment of Harriet Smith, Miss Bates and Mr Martin (Connor Swindells) the farmer who truly loves Harriet,\xa0 is appalling and unforgivable. Yet she just takes over a gift to them and makes it all alright and they forgive her. Emma is just full to overflowing of pride and prejudice. The screenplay and Ms Taylor-Joy conspire to make her seem irredeemable.', 'This makes Johnny Flynn’s Mr Knightley character seem wrong headed in his quiet pursuit of her. Surely he’d be better off with some nice girl, or even with the handsome enigmatic Frank Churchill (Callum Turner), who seems to be interesting him an awful lot. OK, Jane Austen is modern but not that modern.', 'Nevertheless, when romance between Emma and Mr Knightley finally rears its head, Ms Taylor-Joy and Mr Flynn go to its with a credible and rare passion. Passion comes on, the film gets serious, and it goes all Jane Austen. Luckily all the good stuff is in the film’s second half, so it ends satisfyingly and you can forgive the earlier crimes and misdemeanors to Ms Austen’s masterwork.', 'Overall, the acting is as patchy as the film itself, with good mixing effortlessly with weak. Josh O’Connor’s ludicrous, lacivious vicar Mr Elton is hard to play, but he tries to mug and play it for brazen laughs and it doesn’t work. Tanya Reynolds is better as Mrs Elton, but she still doesn’t nail it. She’s not really funny, and the Eltons are the main comedy relief, along with Nighy and Hart.', 'It is Johnny Flynn’s passionate gravity that is the film’s best turn and recommendation, weirdly because it is called Emma and not Mr Knightley. Is Anya Taylor-Joy ideal as Emma? The jury is still out. Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect in 1996 and so was Jeremy Northam as Mr Knightley.', 'The slack pacing, silly comedy and some iffy performances are the main downsides.

Having never read the source novel (nor anything else by Jane Austen, save the bits borrowed and transmogrified by ', '), I took everything at pretty much face value, generally enjoying the relatively breezy antics of the eponymous Emma Woodhouse as she blithely manipulates those around her into various romantic entanglements and whatnot. It’s a fun flick, really, and I didn’t think there was much to think about within. What a difference a few years and a re-adaptation make, eh?', 'The same premise as above is presented in this year’s ', ', with the young Ms. Woodhouse furtively (and not-so-furtively) playing matchmaker with various members of her in-group. Thing is, the concept looks and feels wildly different: The general aesthetic and atmosphere has taken on a slightly more upscale and stylized tack, the costumes a bit stodgier and stiffer, the locales more aristocratically pastoral, the music more stripped-down (in fact, the primary musical affectation comprises a sort of chamber chorale bit interjecting every now and again), and the presentation more – for lack of a better way of putting it – staged. This isn’t to say any of these elements are a step down, far from it, especially in the case of the intricate costumes (designed by frequent Branagh and Marvel collaborator Alexandra Byrne) and jaunty music, but there is definitely a change in management. The overall feel comes across as a lively shadow box of sorts, a breathing and mobile diorama depicting a bygone era. Were these the only shifts, I would wave things away as a nice-looking re-adaptation and be done with it, but then there’s the seeming underlying tone.', 'See, like I said before, 1996’s ', ' is pretty light and breezy, more a literary trifle than anything truly meaningful. This new version, however, looks to have taken a deliberate stance on things and has something to say. While Gwyneth Paltrow lithely drifted through matters with a rather mild zeal, treating her matchmaking almost like an ardent pastime, Anya Taylor-Joy’s interpretation of the character leans in on her stated “very little to distress or vex her” (on-screen titles taken directly from the opening sentences of the novel), undertaking her matchmaking in a manner well in keeping with an upper-crust lady simply going through the socially manipulative motions out of aristocratic ennui. She seems barely interested in her targets in any genuine or deep sense, yet she’s almost compelled to interfere at any available opportunity. The dark blitheness of the upper classes is illustrated rather boldly here, complete with a lack of any appreciable consequences or overt emotions on the part of Ms. Woodhouse. Indeed, this isn’t even shown to be a secret or unknown facet of life in these parts, as Emma’s friend Knightley (played rather sardonically by Johnny Flynn) appears not only used to her machinations but both critical and tired of them; and his mild exasperation is slightly more visibly echoed by her father (played at just the right amount of the usual characteristic schtick by Bill Nighy), who constantly rolls his eyes and sighs as he watches things play out. The boldly blasé manner with which Emma engages in her pursuits is shown rather starkly, contrasted with the livelier and more emotional reactions of her (usually more lower-class, even if only slightly) pawns, and an implicit condemnation of such social pursuits by the wealthier leisure classes is palpable throughout the film. Emma is likened more to a traditionalist fox hunter than anything, going about her hunts because she’s little else to do but plenty of time and comfort in which to do it.\xa0 It’s not a necessarily overt or in-your-face communication, but it’s nevertheless palpable.', 'This is a stark tonal contrast with the previous film, and the fact that one can make such varying interpretations is a testament to Austen’s abilities. This version gave me more to think about than before, and, honestly, that’s a welcome shift. There’s still plenty of humor involved, but it’s a bit droller, less overt than in ’96. While both offer an entertaining experience, I would recommend those that saw the older version or have read the book give this adaptation a shot, as they’re likely to get something novel out of it.

One might think it’s to not to be confused with the 1996 version staring Gwyneth Paltrow, or maybe to simply inform cinema-goers that this is the definitive celluloid (well, digital) version – period! However you take it, de Wilde’s vision of 19th century English countryside is a rich one, rooted in details, period dress and the title character’s ever alluring array of earrings. One astute detail is the use of folding panel draft screens, each a piece of period art in their own right, positioned by the help to keep their wealthy estate owners warm as they relax in the living room gabbing and imbibing a cordial or, more mundanely, reading. In one scene, Emma (Anya Taylor-Joy) instructs the helping hands to move two such panels to exact locations to keep her father (the indomitable Bill Nighy) warm. The hyper (draft) sensitive effete is certainly snug and happy, but what Emma has more intentionally done is create space for her and her next-door neighbor (fields and sculpted gardens away), the overly solemn Mr. Knightley (Johnny Flynn), to whisper privately about affairs of the heart.', 'Emma, it turns out, is a master manipulator, ever so prim on the outside but inside scripting the love lives of the young and unsuspecting roaming the quaint confines of the bucolic burg just a day’s jaunt from London. Those caught up in her matchmaking, besides Knightley, are her tag-along of lower social station, Harriet (a wonderful Mia Goth), a sensitive, hardworking farmer with a square jaw by the name of Robert Martin (Connor Swindells), the prideful world traveler Frank Churchill (Callum Turner) and Emma’s de facto social rival, Jane Fairfax (Amber Anderson). Most of Emma’s semi-well-intentioned plots (most with a modicum of personal gain attached) backfire with a dour muffled cough. Nothing in Austen’s very staid land ever erupts outwardly, though Flynn’s brooding Knightley feels like a bull in a narrow stall looking to explode. It’s a Heath Ledger-esque performance, understated yet thoroughly compelling. (Interestingly, Flynn in is slated to play rockers David Bowie and Ray Davies in upcoming projects.)', 'It’s hard to pick a shining star in de Wilde’s opulent period piece. Goth, Nighy and Miranda Hart as Miss Bates, a nonstop chatterbox as sweet as she is annoying, all add perfect bits of garnish to the Knightley-Emma Woodhouse tug-of-war of emotion and desire. Mark one thing: “Emma.” lifts Taylor-Joy over the top as a serious young performer in the ranks of Thomasin McKenzie (', '” ', ') and Saoirse Ronan (', ' ', '). Coincidentally, the name of her occult young woman in her breakthrough, Robert Egger’s “The Witch” (2015), was Thomasin, and she’ll star this year with McKenzie in the Edgar Wright (', ' Shaun of the Dead”) project “Last Night in Soho.” And as much as Joy-Taylor lifts the film with her ebullient, wide eyes that mask mixed feelings, credit for a work that feels like both a fairytale and a master painting goes to de Wilde – amazingly, at nearly 50, notching her first-time shot. The script by “The Luminaries” novelist Eleanor Catton, like Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women,” metes in just the right amount of modern female gaze without unsettling a single apple in Austen’s cart.

There have been multiple TV movie and miniseries takes on the novel, though, but as the most recent was over a decade ago I guess someone felt it was about time to trot it out again (after all, every major Dickens and Austen must be adapted for the screen at least once a decade or so, right?)', 'Following in the footsteps of the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Beckinsale, and Romola Garai — and, I guess, Alicia Silverstone — in the title role is Anya Taylor-Joy. With her wide eyes, blonde ringleted hair, and silent, still demeanour, Emma is the very vision of loveliness. But, like so many stereotypical outer appearances, her sweet visage masks a manipulative schemer, obsessed with her own matchmaking ability; and, in private, her opinions of others are often not so kind. She is, in short, a bit of a bitch. Taylor-Joy is perfect in the role, doing an awful lot with subtle changes of expression in reaction shots — her Emma may often be silent and still, but she still conveys so much. Some have labelled Taylor-Joy a “scream queen” after her breakthrough roles in the likes of ', ' and ', ', but she’s got a lot more range than that label implies.', 'Around her is a cast mixed of well-known faces and up-and-comers. For the latter, the standout is Josh O’Connor, who you may recognise from ', ', or ', ', or ', ', or one of several other roles — he’s been an up-and-comer for a while and is about due a full-on breakthrough, which I guess all of these things combined have or will provide. Anyway, here he’s an obsequious vicar whose manner changes entirely once his true intentions and character are exposed, and O’Connor tackles both sides with the right amount of humour and churlishness. Johnny Flynn brings a rugged edge to Mr Knightley, Emma’s neighbour and lifelong friend, who disapproves of her meddling ways even as he clearly approves of her. Mia Goth brings a convincing wide-eyed innocence to Harriet Smith, a young girl of unknown parentage who Emma takes under her wing with the real motive of once again showing off her matchmaking skills, which is quite at odds with her previous roles in the likes of ', ' and ', '.', 'As to the better-known cast members, Bill Nighy is reliably drily hilarious as Emma’s father, while Miranda Hart injects a lot of her familiar persona into the babbling Mrs Bates, before hitting you with an almost gut-punch of emotion (there were gasps at my screening, dear reader — ', '). Fans of the book / other adaptations will surely know which moment provokes such a response, so there’s the quality of Austen’s original’s storytelling at work there, and also that of the filmmakers and the rest of the cast — the reactions of the other characters; the way they hastily try to cover up the faux pas; and the exposure of Emma’s true character contrasting with the overall sugariness of the way this world has been presented.', 'This is director Autumn de Wilde’s most striking contribution to the story. The colour palette evokes confectionary; the manner of framing and camera moves is sometimes Wes Anderson-esque. If this Austen adaptation lacks the pure satirical bite of, say, ', ', it counterbalances with a contrast between the prettiness of the design work and the true thoughts, feelings, and schemes of the protagonist.', 'Of course, at the end of the day, ', ' is a romance, and all’s well that ends well, earned via a flurry of apologies and plotting that lands everyone just where they always ought to have been. I suppose such narrative tidiness is anathema to some, just as are the delightful visuals, the witty dialogue, or the fundamental triviality of a bunch of rich people fussing over each other’s love lives. Well, that’s Jane Austen, people. And, like the elaborate confectionary it so resembles, ', ' may not be nutritional, but it is delicious.', 'Emma.', 'Not exactly my cup of tea, really, and certainly not something to drag me to the cinema, but I’ll have to keep an eye out for this one, looks good. Other than Miranda Hart, who I frankly detest on some chemical level, the rest of the cast looks really interesting. Did I spot one of the girls from Sex Education in that second picture? That series has a phenomenal cast of future stars, and it seems they may be breaking out into other material already.', 'It’s a bit like Iannucci’s ', ' in that they’ve jazzed it up just enough to give it a broader appeal than the usual heritage/period drama crowd, but without losing the essence of the story (although it’s not as extreme a re-envisioning as ', ' was).', 'She is indeed someone from ', '.

Tom Holland and Chris Pratt are both incredible and have perfect chemistry. Octavia Spencer and Julia Louis-Dreryfus are both great. As usual the animation is incredible and consistently stunning. The music by Mychael Danna is really good and Dan Scanlon's direction is great."", 'It made me cry\nThe movie was also magical it is a really good family movie please see this i really like this movie great cast great humor great movie', 'Really beautiful and emotional movie. It won me primarily over by its absolutely fantastic and very detailed animations, look and use of colors.\nTruely magical. It had so much time to develope so many different characters even if its just little extras. I would actually watch a TV series based on the lives of those fantasy characters in the suburbans. A very creative idea to actually tell a very simple and common story. The film convinced me because it just touched the right buttons and activated them with the story structure and the relationship between the two leading characters. There is some great voice work, most noteable Tom Holland and Octavia Spencer but also Chris Pratt meets the right tone.\nOne of the best Pixar movies that came out the last years and one of the most creative and magical ones (more in design than story) for a very long time. It got me close to tears at the end and that means something for a animated film. Kudos to Pixar, they know how to bring magic back t the cinema.', ""I like the originality in this movie,\nnothing special imo, i definitly didn't mind watching the movie.\nVoice acting was really great though, the movie definitly got some laughs out of me. Go watch it if you have younger children, nothing special for adults and teens though."", 'I was excited going into Onward because Pixar are one of the only studios making movies today that consistently deliver. Not all of them are as great as some of their classics, but I have never had a bad experience watching a Pixar film and almost all of them are great. Some of them are down-right masterpieces.', ""Onward isn't a masterpiece, but it's close to being one. At the heart of the story are two brothers, voiced excellently by Tom Holland and Chris Pratt. Their voices brought to much energy to the characters, and the dynamic between the two of them was electrifying and engaging."", ""The overall story of Onward is nothing ground-breaking, but it is immensely entertaining and there was never a dull moment. This isn't my favourite Pixar film, but it's definitely up there. The musical score was heart-pounding and added to the tension in all the right places."", 'All of the characters, especially the two brothers, have a very significant arc in the film and it was a pure joy to watch on-screen. The ending is also the most emotional I have been in a Pixar film since the inferno scene at the end of Toy Story 3, almost a decade ago. When you understand what the actual message of the story is, behind the road-trip adventure they go on, it will move you and grab you by the heartstrings.', ""The pacing didn't always flow as well as I would have liked in the first act, and there were a couple of real-world elements which I had to suspend too much disbelief for, but overall this is an absolutely incredible film and I can't wait to see it again."", 'SCORE: 93%', ""I've heard people compare this to Frozen, but for boys. It's not that good. The dead parent thing has been done to death (pun intended), and I did go in knowing the theme, but it was just a bit, boring. Chris Pratt clearly wasn't let loose in the script or acting and was a bit of a disappointment. The visuals are good."", ""Very heartwarming blast of glorious adventures and spells! Glad I got to see an advance screening today, it was nice to see adults by themselves and kids. Had several epic parts along some sad stuff too. Onward is delightful especially Chris Pratt I love his character! I highly recommend this cool well done kids movie to anyone when it's actually out. I have Asperger's syndrome can you guys chill with the dislikes!"", 'ONWARD, was AMAZING!! Strong story line & very enjoyable!! Must see!!! It honestly will bring your family together strong.', ""I saw the movie yesterday at a pre release screening. While the animation was very smooth and enchanting as was the voice acting the story was flat. It's a coming of age story that you wanted to have a sweet happy ending."", 'As the movie progressed it became increasingly sad. The whole hauling around the fathers legs was a bit much for me, and every time Ian tries to interact with his dad just made me feel more sorry for the character. The brother was an annoying character and was also a bit hard to like. All the other characters in the story were just thrown in with very little depth. To me the ending was just not what I wanted from this movie and I left the theater feeling depressed. Just could have been more wonder in this movie than there was. Too bad as it could have been much better.', ""A funny, beautiful film. It's not top-tier Pixar, but I definitely recommend it. The chemistry between the two brothers is the highlight and can be relatable for both siblings and people who've lost a close relative."", 'Set in a realm where mystical creatures have swapped the magical for the mechanical and mundane, Onward tells the story of two elf brothers, who, after a botched attempt to bring their dead father back to life, end up on a quest to complete the spell and spend one final perfect day in the company of a man they never really knew.', 'While the animation may not feature sequences as utterly jaw dropping as in Coco, Zootopia, or even the recent Frozen 2,what it lacks in the retina scorching department, it certainly makes up for in feels and pure goofball humour.', ""Essentially a road trip/odd couple/chase movie, Onward's strength lies in how the central relationship between the older, brasher, RPG obsessed Barley and the younger, introverted, nerdier Ian plays out."", ""There are some killer lines, awesome visual gags, and fairly amusing side plots featuring characters as memorable as any in Pixar's greatest hits (The Manticore, I'm looking at you kid). The emotional coda in the last ten minutes also had me weeping, although that may be more to do with my complicated family history than anything else. Or I had all the things in both my eyes. Potatoes/Potatoes."", ""Overall, it's a big, bright and breezy rollicker, and whilst not as polished as other recent offerings from the Haus of Maus animation arm, its zany conceit and chemistry poppin' central pairing helps keep things upbeat and interesting throughout. I give it an artful 8/10."", 'Onwards is an enjoyable and magickal journey not to be missed. Although not your standard pixar movie, onwards is filled with creative and imaginative concepts with great influence from mythology, spiritual theory and board games such as Dungeons and Dragons.', 'The story between the two brothers was gripping and as realistic as a fantasy animation can get, and with the film being inspired by director Dan Scanlons story of him losing his father, brings more of an emotional connection, especially nearing the end of the film (no spoilers). I enjoyed the connection that Tom Holland and Chris Pratt brought to the film with their talented voice acting skills and really brought the characters and their circumstances to life.', 'Spiritual ideology is hidden within the script as the movie explores concepts such as manifestation, believing in yourself and ofcorse magick itself. There are quite a few inspirational quotes that can be pulled from this story and used in general day to day life or to even inspire and motivate you to move towards your dreams and to realise what you can truly accomplish.', ""Onward also sees Pixar's first lgbt character, which continues to show that animation and the film industry are moving on to educate that the norm that was once known is not the norm of today. Even with the subtlety of a police officer referencing her girlfriend briefly during a scene, brings hope that movies aimed at younger generations are developing a better sense of tolerance and brings more hope to the future."", ""I would recommend this film definately, however also understand it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for me personally this film deserves a 10/10."", ""The dead parent trope might be overused for Disney movies but Onward doesn't make the mistakes of those movies. The siblings fight like siblings though out, not just at plot critical moments. Their single mom has a boyfriend who is not an evil stepparent trope, and their mom is actually proactive during the events of the film, but the adventure still belongs to the boys. I've been tired of plots that have parents oblivious to what their kids are doing. I came for the DnD references but I cried for the well-rounded characters."", 'After seeing ""Onward"", I do hope this movie is no indicator for the quality of Pixar\'s productions after the departure of John Lasseter. In my opinion, ""Onward"" is the least inventive and entertaining Pixar movie since ""The good dinosaur"".', 'Yet, the basic idea has potential: Once there was magic, but by and by it was replaced by civilization. This civilized world looks a lot like some random US provincial town - except that it is populated by magical, mythical creatures like Elves, Fairies, Centaurs, Dwarfs, Trolls and so on. No humans! This has the potential for a lot of gags, e.g., a Centaur (named ""Bronco""!) as police officer - in a car. On the other hand: This is no new idea; similar parodies on Smalltown America has been seen in ""Chicken Little"", ""Planet 51"", ""Antz"" or ""Bee movie"", to name only a few CGI movies. There is nothing really new and inventive here as, e.g., the land of the Dead in ""Coco"".', 'Most obvious would be a comparison with ""Shrek"", which features also a world of magical, mythical creatures. Yet while ""Shrek"" has a satirical, cheeky approach to its world and its \'people\', ""Onward"" shows a more sentimental, sometimes even corny approach. The \'magical\' times are introduced as some kind of lost, yet golden age - which is strange somehow, since all the ingredients of this magic age are still there.', 'Another problem of ""Onward"" are its main characters, the brothers Lightfoot: Elves with blue skin and pointy ears, yet otherwise completely just like some average teenagers of 16 (Ian) and 18 (?, Barley). Great, two more moody teenagers! And there is another stereotype: They are half-orphans, since their father has died even before Ian\'s birth; since then, Ian seems to long for his lost father. His brother, on the other hand, is shown as a screw-up, role-playing and driving an ancient bus. The most likable person in the family is their hands-on mother.', 'As in ""Coco"", ""Onward"" tackles the contact to the hereafter. But while in ""Coco"" Mexican traditions and myths are used, in ""Onward"" it just feels creepy: In the beginning, Ian summons (more or less by accident) his father - but only up to the waistline! Does that mean that the rest of him is still somewhere in the afterworld?', 'Anyway: Barley and Ian have to hit the road to summon also the rest of their father, since for some reason they have only 24 h for that. This way, we also get a road trip, and while this is probably the most entertaining part of the movie, it is also no new, inventive idea; far from it.', 'Don\'t get me wrong: ""Onward"" is not a bad movie; is has a lot of funny moments, and the visuals are great. But in my view, it is not very memorable.', ""I really enjoyed this movie. It's a fun, fast paced adventure with real emotional content."", ""I loved the story and there were a few moments that made me laugh out loud. I'm a father of two boys and the relationship between the brothers struck a few chords with me."", 'All the characters are great fun and the animation and voice acting is spot on.', 'Great family film and well worth a watch.', 'The film here seems like it is missing something . The story is alright , not super developed (pretty straightforward) . The characters don\'t really grow on the audience much. I was hoping more from this, the film kinda makes the viewer want to move ""onward"" from watching the film. A bit boring in my opinion. Don\'t recommend.', ""This film has some creativity to it, but the theme of death seems to have the whole film under a gloom. The story is not well developed and the characters in the film just seem to exist in order to learn a important lesson (kind of obvious lesson) . The film seems to lack in terms of cinematic experience. This would have been better if released on DVD or Disney plus . Too much is lacking here. Don't recommend it."", ""Pixar are back with two films in 2020 and their first one is a hit. The film centres around brothers Ian and Barley Lightfoot - two elves whose father died when they were too young to remember him. Given the opportunity to spend a day with him by a magical staff and spell, the boys of course try it out but it doesn't go as planned. This is where the film heads off into their quest to find a gem that can help complete the spell for their father who has returned only as a pair of legs. That's right, folks, Pixar have made a film about a pair of legs. And what a studio to do it. Right from the beginning the film is filled with laughs a minute and great voice acting from Tom Holland (Ian) and Chris Pratt (Barley). You will believe the brotherly relationship between them, as the script is so natural that you can't help but get lost in the mythical world and root for our two heroes. The film isn't without its flaws, however. Unlike Pixar films that have come before, there seems to be something missing here that doesn't give it that level of Pixar magic as in the likes of 'Inside Out', 'Toy Story' and 'Up' to name a few. 'Onward' is more on the level of 'Cars' and 'Brave' in that it's a very good and enjoyable film, but nothing memorable. And much like 'The Good Dinosaur', the backgrounds of the film are so photo realistic, that it's hard to tell this film is animated at times, until the characters come on screen. The animation for mythical creatures is hard to make real; however, Pixar have been so good in the past with rats, toys and monsters, you can't help but feel that the animation lacks in this area. The score as well isn't as memorable as others, making one yearn for Michael Giacchino and his France themed score for 'Ratatouille' or Mexican themed score for 'Coco'. Taking these aside, the film follows that straightforward quest/journey plot and makes you laugh and smile throughout until the end where, although you're expecting it, the tears begin to well up and a warm fuzzy feeling enters your heart. Yes, Pixar will make you cry over a pair of legs in purple socks."", ""'Onward' is a formulaic animated film that is funny, heartwarming and action-packed, but lacks in that special touch that so many Pixar films have had woven into them."", 'So many fake reviews before official release, unreal', 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)', 'I always struggle to find reasons to dislike a Pixar film. One of the most annoying preconceived notions about genres is the one about animated movies. ""They\'re for children, how can you enjoy stuff like that, you\'re so childish"", people say. Little do they know that animated flicks have as much or more emotionally compelling narratives and characters than live-action films. The score is usually more important in the former genre, and the visuals always look stunning. The partnership Disney-Pixar is probably the best thing that could have happened to Hollywood.', ""Dan Scanlon delivered a surprisingly good sequel to Monsters Inc. back in 2013 with Monsters University. Making an efficient sequel twelve years after its original is a challenging task, and Scanlon succeed, so I had good expectations going in. Onward might not be one of Pixar's best movies, and I doubt that a lot of people will place it as one of their favorites when comparing with the studio's films of the same type. However, it still carries the trademark emotional narrative with relatable characters that Pixar always delivers."", ""I grew up with a father, mother, and two older brothers. Just with this information, I know that I'm luckier than a whole bunch of people all around the world. Onward focuses on the relationship between two siblings (Chris Pratt and Tom Holland), and I love their adventure together. It made me recall my childhood and the awesome moments I shared with my brothers. If you're a fan of Dungeons & Dragons or other quest-based games, the main plot's structure will definitely please you as it did me, but it's connected to my biggest gripe..."", 'The concept is pretty neat, but its execution lacks a little bit of more... magic, as ironic as it might be. For example, Frozen II isn\'t about a ""world full of magic"", but Elsa (Idina Menzel) alone has more magical scenes than Onward in its entirety. In the former, the actual magic feels the screen with stunning animation and chill-inducing music. Onward feels like a diminished version of its true potential. While it\'s true that the world where the main characters live in has lost its overwhelming magic from the past, their adventure is filled with obstacles which they deal with... you guessed it, magic.', 'I don\'t want to sound like that guy who only wants ""action for the sake of action"". I hate when people dislike a movie simply because they didn\'t see enough stuff exploding or something. It\'s a bit about expectations and about what I know Pixar can do. Obviously, I\'m expecting more from them now more than ever. It\'s not that the story isn\'t interesting or captivating because there\'s definitely an entertaining vibe throughout the whole runtime. It\'s well-paced, there\'s always something going on, and the humor is pitch-perfect. It\'s GOOD. Simple as that.', ""The voice acting is fantastic. Tom Holland and especially Chris Pratt really incorporate their characters' spirit, and it's almost palpable that the actors had tons of fun behind-the-scenes. Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Octavia Spencer are also quite good, but their characters' respective arcs aren't near as compelling as the primary narrative. Every moment I spent with them is every moment I wanted to go back to the brothers. However, the fun and entertainment never go away. The story never fails to be exciting, it just goes increases and decreases its level ever so slightly."", 'I saved the best for last. Even though the second act feels a tad repetitive, the ending is incredibly satisfying. Predictable? Yes. Will it be underwhelming/disappointing for some people? Surely. But it delivers the most beautiful of messages in the most emotional way possible, as Pixar always manages to do. A lot of nice, small morals are learned throughout the story, but the final one is absolutely perfect, and it left some tears in my eyes. The ending is heartfelt and genuine for everyone, but it will have a tremendous impact on families that lost a member way too soon.', ""All in all, the Disney-Pixar's partnership continues to provide the world with the best animated films of each year. Onward is the most recent success, even though it lacks a bit of magic and creativity when compared to the studio's movies of the same genre. Boasting a talented voice cast, the two brothers go on a fun, quest-based adventure that concludes with a wonderful, heartfelt message to every family out there. Some people might find the ending too predictable and underwhelming, but the climax is emotionally powerful, and it will unquestionably cause an impact on everyone (tissues, anyone?). Its second act feels a bit repetitive, but the entertainment never fades away. Hilarious and clever humor, compelling main characters, not-that-interesting secondary characters, and gorgeous animation as always. The end credits song is pretty cool too. Can't wait for Soul..."", ""This movie had no point in ever being made. Disney/ Pixar really aren't living up to the name. The movie is plain boring and dull. Awful."", ""Greetings again from the darkness. No studio has ever had a 25 year run like Pixar. This is their 22nd feature film over that span and every single one lands somewhere in the range of brilliant/instant classic to watchable/re-watchable. Though this latest may not reach instant classic level, it does stick to the Pixar standard template of highly entertaining while delivering a life lesson. This is the first time in the Pixar director's chair for Dan Scanlon since MONSTERS UNIVERSITY (2013). It's also the first original Pixar since COCO (2017) ... and note, it's rated PG."", 'The film opens with a ""history"" lesson detailing how the world was once populated by enchanted creatures like elves, unicorns, wizards, mermaids, fairies and sprites. Science and technology created shortcuts and soon the world\'s ""magic"" had disappeared, relegating these creatures to life in the suburbs. We pick up the story on Ian Lightfoot\'s 16th birthday. Ian is part of an elf family that includes his older brother Barley and their widowed mother Laurel. While Barley is a loud and rambunctious type who is obsessed with the Quest of Yore game and mythology (think Dungeons & Dragons), Ian is a more pensive type who still mourns the late father he never met. Both brothers are surprised when their mother presents a ""gift"" from their dad - one he left instructions to be held until Ian turned 16. The gift is a magical wizard staff that, with the included precious stone, can bring dad back to life for 24 hours.', ""Barley's knowledge of the magical spells combined with Ian's lack of self-confidence ends up botching things to the point that only half of dad is brought back - the bottom half. Under a tight deadline and in need of a replacement gem to bring dad back for a much desired final conversation, the brothers take off on an adventure that turns pretty wild. Their quest leads them to cross paths with many of the previously enchanted creatures, including the fabulous Manticore, and mom's boyfriend, Officer Colt Bronco."", ""We have come to expect 'magic' from Pixar with every movie, and this one doesn't disappoint. It may not be quite as awe-inspiring as some of their best work, but it's still a terrific suburban fantasy adventure filled with comedy and life lessons ... the most crucial of which is: being happy with what you have is more crucial to your inner-peace than getting what you hope for."", ""As always, the voice acting is top notch.

The likely reason is that the studio has a second original film being released this June.

Given the time of year, it could be easy to overlook ONWARD, but it nails the Pixar trademark emotional finale ... delivering a sentimental scene likely to stick with you. I have praised Pixar many times over the years as their creative teams really seem to ""get it"". Regardless of the month, ONWARD will cast a spell.', 'Onward\n2020\nU\nDirector: Dan Scanlon\nStarring: Tom Holland, Chris Pratt, Julia Louise Dreyfus, Octavia Spencer etc\nOverall rating 95/100', ""\nOnward is based on two brothers called Barley (Chris Pratt) and Ian ( Tom Holland) who gets awarded a wizards staff on his 16th birthday in order to bring back their dead father for just one more day. They must embark on a quest to retrieve everything they need for the spell; relationships will be tested but will the brothers come out the end as united as they were when they started. Wow what a fantastic movie onward was. Truly Pixar at its best with a beautifully thought out original idea there are a lot of good things to say about this so let's get started."", 'First of all, the films animation and world building were fantastic. Wow this films animation was fantastic to look at. Whether it was the fantastic character designs of all the different characters. Or the attention to detail with normal day to day things that made the film look incredibly realistic. They just did so many fun things with the animation that just kept you consistently entertained, and it was completely different to any other animated movie which was another added bonus. The worldbuilding was also incredible for the film. The films delved in deep with the world of Onward and it payed off really well. They went into great detail travelling to multiple different locations and it really made me feel part of there world which is a fantastic thing to feel when watching and made it slightly more believable and fun to watch.', 'Next the film had very likeable characters great chemistry between characters and good usage of secondary characters. There was so many great and likeable characters. Ian had a lovely charm that made you instantly like him as his social awkwardness and struggling to fit in at school will make a lot of people connect to him as a character. And Barley was despite his flaws very likeable as well. And their chemistry as brothers was fantastic, authentic and believable. As their relationship developed as the film went on I grew more and more of a connection with both of the characters, and their brother ship really connected with me and I am sure most audience members who have siblings. I also loved that they gave the secondary characters of the mum Laurel (Julia Louise Dreyfuss) and Manticore (Octavia Spencer) a lot of screen time as well. This was great because they actually felt like part of the movie instead of afterthoughts. They had good character arcs and likeable personalities. With the mum being a character that like her sons is very easy to connect with and got more and more likeable, but also Manticore, her bubbly out there personality really worked and bought the most humour for me as Octavia Spencer did fantastic voice work.', ""Next the film was very funny and had excellent character development. This movie was very funny. With Barley and Manticore definitely providing the most laughs, it balanced its humour and emotion perfectly, with Barleys constant game references and excellent slapstick comedy with his car Gwenevere and Manticore with her witty fast paced humour that always made you laugh. This film also had fantastic character development. Manticore went from being not herself with being the owner of her restaurant to being encouraged to not shy away from her past and be her true self which I thought was great. Ian's was fantastic. As he went from being the shy and antisocial kid to growing in confidence and finding himself and realising how much his brother meant to him after there conflict was a fantastic touch as well."", ""My only two slight nit-picks at the beginning of the film would be its slight pacing inconsistencies and playing it slightly safe. I felt like the film took a little while to properly find its feet. As there were a few scenes that were dragged out slightly to long and effecting the pacing briefly. They also played it slightly safe with the humour and action but this was more than redeemed in the second half but it's still worth mentioning as I did notice this in the first 20-30 minutes."", 'My next two positives would be the films magical elements and fantastic final act. This film really explored its magical elements which was great, this was Barleys speciality which made his character very likeable with his vast knowledge. I loved all the different spells casted and all the different things that Ian had to do in order to cast it, this also led to a lot of comedic moments as well which was great. This also led to a fantastically entertaining final act. As the curse of the phoenix stone lifted a finale battle between Ian and the dragon insued which was of course incredibly entertaining. As they also incorporated the secondary characters very well. It was just incredibly satisfying to have a big magical final act, characters reunited and emotional pay off.', ""My final few positives would be the films heart-warming tone, emotional weight and deep themes and messages about society. Wow this film was incredibly heart-warming, as the film went into detail about how Ian and Barley grew up without a father, their was loads of heart-warming heart to hearts between the brothers or with their mum which really made you emotionally connect with their characters a lot more. Which moves me onto the next point the film had an incredible amount of emotional weight to it. We have come to expect this with Pixar but this felt so organic and natural instead of forced. The film's most emotional moments surprisingly wasn't from the brothers reuniting with their father which is what I was expecting, despite it still being emotional the true emotion came from the brothers realising how they meant to each other, when Ian had a checklist of things to do with his dad, and when he thought he couldn't do those things but realised that Barley was like a father figure to him all of his life It was an incredibly emotional moment. And the films messages about family bereavement, brotherhood and finding yourself was incredibly insightful and left a big impact on me."", ""Overall Onward is one of Pixar's stronger films with fantastic characters and worldbuilding, fantastic animation and character development. And like we have come to expect with Pixar a perfect blend of humour and emotion, leading me to conclude that Pixar is the best animation company there is."", 'Amazing, tear-jerker, cute, funny, worthwhile film! the story, the journey, the characters and magic made this film a must see.', 'Onward is one of the best Pixar movies that have been made. The movies is magical yet amazing. It shows one of the best bonds i have seen in a Disney/Pixar movie. It shows how these two brothers are able to accomplish anything that they set their mind to and are able to work together to complete this journey that they take to find their father. Though it may be an exciting and fun movie to watch its also very emotional. The hardship and rough spots that they had to go through was very touching. In the over all end i hope this pushes you to go Watch Onward.

And faith in something, ', ', is essential to the studio’s latest feature, ', ', as the heroes of this comic fantasy are two teenage elves who go searching for the magical gem—and the self-assurance—needed to briefly resurrect their departed and sorely missed father.', 'Ian and Barley Lightfoot’s (Tom Holland and Chris Pratt) 24-hour quest is lively and sometimes funny but seldom surprising. Writer-director Dan Scanlon and co-scripters Jason Headley and Keith Bunin have assembled a story from spare parts of various adventure and sword-and-sorcery flicks, and topped it with a sentimental coda about the value of a male role model. Mychael Danna and Jeff Danna’s drippy score pleads for tears, but viewers who sniffle are more likely to have been moved by personal associations than the film’s emotional heft.', 'Blue-haired, pointy-eared Ian and Barley live with their widowed mom, Laurel (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), in a neighborhood that’s a cross between Tolkien’s Shire and a near-contemporary California suburb. A prologue explains that “long ago the world was filled with magic,” but enchantment succumbed to a diabolical adversary: science. The invention of the light bulb is presented as this toontown’s fall from grace. What’s left is a ', '-like cosmos where such mythic creatures as centaurs, mermaids, cyclopses, and, of course, elves live together in stultifying ordinariness. Most stultified of all is Ian, who meekly accepts the torments of high school. He’s nearly the opposite of brash older brother Barley, a true believer in magic who crusades to preserve the old ways and is devoted to a mystical role-playing game he insists is based on the world as it used to be. (A few of the film’s supporting characters appear by courtesy of Wizards of the Coast, the game company that owns ', '.)', 'It’s Ian’s 16th birthday, so Laurel retrieves a gift left by the boys’ father, who died before the younger one was born. The package contains a magical staff and instructions on how to revive a dead soul, if only for 24 hours. It turns out that Ian has an aptitude for incantations but lacks knowledge and, crucially, confidence. He casts a spell that succeeds but only halfway, as it summons just Dad’s lower half. A mysterious crystal could finish the job, so the brothers hit the road in Barley’s beat-up but vaguely magical van with a gear shift that reads “onward.” Barley is certain that his role-playing game can direct them to their shadowy destination.', 'Like most quest sagas, ', ' is an episodic one, but it doesn’t make most of its pitstops especially memorable. The supporting characters are few and most are easily forgotten, save for a once-terrifying but now-domesticated manticore, Corey (Octavia Spencer), and Mom’s cop boyfriend, Colt Bronco (Mel Rodriguez), who may be a centaur but strikes his potential stepsons as embarrassingly bourgeois. Both join a frantic Laurel on her sons’ trail.', ' doesn’t have a distinctive visual style, but it does showcase Pixar’s trademark mastery of depth, light, and shadow. As in Scanlon’s ', ', the fanciful and the everyday are well harmonized. That’s still a neat trick, but it’s no more novel than Ian and Barley’s experiences. Animated features often borrow from other films, in part to keep the grown-ups in the crowd interested, but the way ', ' recalls at various points ', ', ', ', and ', ' feels perfunctory and uninspired. And it all leads to a moral that’s at least as hoary as that of ', ' or ', '. While ', ' begins as a story of bereavement, it soon turns to celebrating the payoffs of positive thinking.

In its most sophisticated and surprising moments, it twists the audience’s expectations of this type of film—about a ragtag band of underdogs who rally under the leadership of a flawed but passionate coach—at times even exposing the artifice of its own genre conventions. But, ultimately, O’Connor and screenwriter Brad Ingelsby’s attempts to ground ', ' in a sense of emotional realism is overwhelmed by their willingness to slake our thirst for resolution and hopefulness. The result is a film that makes the path to basketball glory and the road to personal redemption seem oddly effortless.', ' opens with a well-observed sequence introducing us to Jack Cunningham (Ben Affleck), the former high school basketball star who’s become a drunk. Jack guzzles a cold one in the shower first thing in the morning, and as soon as he gets off work, he fills a cup full of beer for the drive home. He’s a barely functioning alcoholic who’s isolated himself from his concerned but withholding sister (Michaela Watkins) and still pines for his ex-wife (Janina Gavankar), who’s moved on with her life since their separation. These early scenes are lived-in and naturalistic, evoking Jack’s aimlessness and repressed anger without obvious cues.', 'Jack receives a lifeline in the form of an offer to coach the basketball team at his alma mater, Bishop Hayes High School. The team has fallen on hard times, as enrollment at the school has declined over the last couple decades. At first, he’s resistant to the idea, practicing his rejection speech over and over while getting drunker and drunker before eventually passing out; Jack’s increasing belligerence offers a sad and darkly funny showcase for Affleck’s tightly coiled yet surprisingly expressive performance. Ultimately, Jack relents and, after some growing pains, whips six shrimpy, unformed kids into an unstoppable force racking up win after win.', 'As a teenager, Jack turned down a full-ride basketball scholarship to the University of Kansas—an act of spite against his opportunistic father, who never took an interest in his son except when he was on the basketball court. Jack has paid dearly for that decision, spiraling downward into addiction, despair, and a total rejection of the game he once loved. ', ' generates a compelling and refreshingly small-scale sense of emotional tension as Jack, for the first time since high school, re-enters the world of sports that he left behind, bringing his repressed rage to the game as he curses out refs and entreats his squad to throw elbows and play rough: “I will not coach a team that has been out-toughed!”', 'In these early scenes, O’Connor seamlessly unites the two strands of this narrative (Jack’s addiction and the team’s development), but Ingelsby’s script doesn’t quite seem to believe in the power of its own simple premise. Melodramatic subplots are piled on top of each other, including one revelation about an hour into ', ' that feels like emotional extortion. This needless upping of the stakes comes at the expense of the film’s supposed raison d’etre: Jack’s relationship with the kids he’s coaching. Only one of the players, Marcus (Melvin Gregg), even registers as a full-fledged character, but the shy star of the team still comes loaded up with an overwrought backstory that all too neatly parallels Jack’s daddy issues.', ' climaxes, as it must, with an all-or-nothing showdown against Hayes High School’s powerful arch rivals. But, in the film’s smartest and most resonant move, one that cleverly exposes the artifice of its own genre conventions, this big game doesn’t resolve much of anything. Instead, it’s merely the momentary high before Jack hits the lowest of lows. After he gets fired from the team for showing up to a practice stinking of booze, Jack goes on a bender that ends with him crashing his car, stumbling into the wrong house, and getting severely roughed up in a confrontation with the homeowner. For a moment, ', ' seems to be the rare sports film that recognizes that the gritty glory of competition can’t solve all your problems. Ultimately, however, it succumbs to the demands of its genre, with a final passage that cross-cuts between scenes of Jack in rehab and shots of his players excitedly rallying themselves for their first playoff game by shouting, “Win this one for Coach Cunningham!”—all while Rob Simonsen’s score, which shamelessly apes Vangelis’s iconic ', ' theme, gradually swells to a mawkish crescendo.', 'O’Connor has a knack for rendering even the corniest sports-movie clichés with a quiet naturalism that almost makes you forget how many times you’ve seen this sort of thing before. With ', ' and ', ', ', ' forms a kind of trilogy for O’Connor of hard-edged male weepies about the redemptive power of sport. But where ', ' offered exceptionally realistic ice hockey action and ', ' featured bone-crunching MMA combat (along with a fair bit of overloaded post-recession social melodrama), ', ' is oddly light on actual basketball. Aside from a well-composed set piece laying out a particular play, there’s scarcely a memorable moment of game-playing in the whole film. And, more problematic, there’s not enough to convince us of any real bond between Jack and his players. How do they get so good so fast? And what is it about coaching them that reignites Jack’s passion for life? By the end of the film, the answers to these questions remain frustratingly vague.', ' ', ' Ben Affleck, Al Madrigal, Michaela Watkins, Janina Gavankar, Glynn Turman, Brandon Wilson, Hayes MacArthur, Rachael Carpani, Marlene Forte, Lukas Gage, Melvin Gregg, Charles Lott Jr, Chris Bruno ', ' Gavin O’Connor ', ' Brad Ingelsby ', ' Warner Bros.

But it also refers to the young, wannabe triad member with the unlikely name of Autumn Moon (Sam Lee), as well as to the production circumstances of the film itself. Its declarative label is somewhat excessive, though, as there’s no mistaking where and when Moon’s misadventures take place: Chan’s quirky, gangster-adjacent flick, so infused with washed-out and blue-filtered imagery, presents a portrait of Hong Kong that bears more than a passing resemblance to Wong Kar-wai and Christopher Doyle’s early collaborations.', 'From its handheld shots racing through open-air markets, to its use of expressionistic step-printed slow motion, to the way its perspectives on the city take inspiration from the cramped geometry of tiny Hong Kong flats, ', ' owes a lot to Wong’s breakout work. The content and structure of the story, too, is reminiscent of ', ' and ', '. Moon, a youthful and essentially innocent small-time loan shark, narrates his chance encounters and near-misses in the city in a naïve, contemplative voiceover. Although there’s no lack of plot, the film is as much about milieu as it is about events; its rather loose cause-and-effect sequence allows it to soak in the atmosphere of Moon’s subjective world.', 'The threads of the story weave in and out of each other in an almost desultory manner. Moon and his buddy Sylvester (Wenders Li, performing a broad, offensive caricature of an intellectually disabled gangster) discover the bloodied suicide letters of a teen girl named Susan (Amy Tam Ka-Chuen) and must deliver them to their intended recipients. The pair encounter Ping (Neiky Hui-Chi Yim), the daughter of one of the debtors they’re meant to shake down, and Moon promptly falls in lust, creating a conflict of interest with his mob boss, Brother Wing (Sang Chan). After discovering his father has absconded with a mistress, Moon periodically arms himself with a meat cleaver, vowing to avenge this betrayal of his mother (Doris Yan-Wah Chow), even if she doesn’t seem to care very much. She dissuades him at first, and after he resumes the quest later, he’s given pause when, en route to take out his dad, he witnesses another son dismembering a father in a restroom stall.', 'Throughout Chan’s film, comic irreverence intermingles with cosmic coincidences—shades again of the Hong Kong we know from ', '. If ', ' faces reasonable charges of derivativeness, it doesn’t help that the beautiful Ping—who turns out to be dying of renal failure and in desperate need of both cash and a set of kidneys—sports Faye Wong’s iconic pixie cut from the former film. (Ping, never much of a character in her own right, might be described as a depressive pixie-cut dream girl.)', 'Still, it’s difficult not to get caught up in the film’s frantic tour through Hong Kong—and through Moon’s juvenile head space. An inveterate wet-dreamer whose daily morning routine involves rinsing out his underpants, Moon tells us about his distinctly un-erotic, cum-centric fantasies, to which we’re also given visual access: shooting ejaculate at the low-flying airplanes that perpetually pass over Hong Kong’s urban mass, or, in another recurring dream, imagining the blood running from under Susan’s mangled corpse transforming into milk-white liquid. All of Hong Kong seems little more than some version of Moon’s dreamworld, but reality is encroaching, in the form of death. As Moon says the last time he dreams of Susan, “There were tears on my face instead of cum—were they Susan’s?”', 'This line’s mixture of crassness and melodrama lands, but overall, ', ' doesn’t successfully execute its pivot from the irreverent to the sincere, once things get serious for Moon. With its quick cuts and frenetic camerawork, it succeeds in capturing the pounding exuberance of being young in an urban environment—as in ', ' and Godard’s ', ', surely other reference points for Chan, some of the film’s best shots are just its misfit characters running in spaces they should know better than to run in—but it doesn’t manage to fuse this rebellious energy with the Wong-ian wistfulness it evidently aims for.', ' ', ' Sam Lee, Neiky Hui-Chi Yim, Wenders Li, Amy Tam Ka-Chuen, Sang Chan, Doris Yan-Wah Chow ', ' Fruit Chan ', ' Fruit Chan ', ' Metrograph Pictures ', ' 109 min ', ' NR ', ' 1997', 'So many grandiose tactics portend a grander revelation than the film’s otherwise low-key three-hander delivers.', 'Published', 'on', 'By', 'riter-director William Nicholson’s ', ' dutifully but monotonously traces the dissolution of a nearly 30-year marriage. Where the garrulous, headstrong Grace (Annette Bening) finds herself still fighting to save the relationship despite her constant disappointment, Edward (Bill Nighy) is tightly wound, reserved, and seemingly content to quell arguments, his irresponsiveness only further permitting a build-up of resentment. Their bickering appears to be a daily routine, with almost every one of their fights cut short by Edward leaving the room. But Nicholson’s script fails to give either of them much specificity beyond their polar-opposite behaviors. They’re more archetypes of a feuding couple than flesh-and-blood people who were in love with one another at some point in their lives.', 'Nicholson’s failure to probe Grace and Edward’s interior landscapes, or even get at the root problems of their marriage, only makes the film’s attempts at big emotional gestures feel all the more hollow. Indeed, both are so thinly conceived that we learn virtually all we will about them by the time they split a half hour into the film. The arrival of their twentysomething son, Jamie (Josh O’Connor), throws a potentially interesting kink into the mix, especially when it’s revealed that Edward requested his son’s presence so that someone could help him cushion the emotional blow of Grace being told that he’s leaving her. But rather than explore the dysfunctional context of this father-son relationship and whatever led up to such a callous, manipulative decision, Nicholson settles for propping Jamie as the helpless middleman between his mother, who refuses to accept that her marriage is over, and his father, who quickly absconds to shack up with his mistress, Angela (Sally Rogers).', 'Nicholson adapted ', ' from his own 1999 play ', ', and its stagebound origins are apparent throughout. While Bening brings an underlying warmth to her role that could easily have been simplistically shrill in another actor’s hands, the other performers are more visibly constrained by the flimsy characterizations offered to them. Any signs of the spontaneous messiness, rage, and sorrow that accompanies most divorces are smoothed over by dialogue that’s so precisely phrased that it’s rendered listless. All the while, the filmmaking exudes the generic sheen of prestige picture, especially across the long, sweeping drone shots of the cliffside U.K. town of Seaford, where the film is set.', 'For being so disconnected from the drama at hand, the panoramic beauty of those interludes is as jarring as the voiceovers of Grace quoting John Keats’s poems and Edward laboriously recounting tales of soldiers who leave the wounded behind in order to assure their own survival. All are grandiose tactics that portend a grander revelation than the film’s otherwise low-key three-hander delivers. But most damning is the shortage of quotidian details that might have given us a richer sense of the lives lived and marriage lost in this patch of the world.

There’s evil in choosing between killing just one person or many, and in killing some so that one can love others. There’s evil in bureaucracy, in family secrets, in selective rectitude. And there’s evil in selfish refusals masquerading as ethical stances.', 'In fact, for Rasoulof, evil seems to be the most significant organizing force of daily life—the evil of past actions, present decisions, and atemporal structures—in a culture such as Iran’s that accepts murder as a legitimate form of punishment. ', ', then, doesn’t try to facetiously dispel the statement that its title makes by asking whether or not evil exists. It ponders, instead, how citizen’s position themselves in relationship to the inevitable evil that runs through their country’s core, architecting its every corner and generations of people.', 'Each section of the film is independently titled and abides by a different genre, and as such could function as a standalone short. The first is arguably the strongest because we’re still oblivious to the games Rasoulof may want to play with us. The filmmaker masterfully plays off of our ignorance, spending almost the entirety of the segment making us believe in a realistic portrait of the everyday life of a perfectly happy, and drama-free, middle-class family in Iran, saving one of the most unexpected plot twists in all of cinema to the very last shot.', 'In retrospect, Heshmat’s (Ehsan Mirhosseini) life should have been too good to be true. When we first meet him, he’s playing the neighborhood hero, saving a kitten stuck in a hole. He then patiently listens to his wife’s (Shahi Jila) infinite list of mundane complaints as he drives, in a lengthy sequence that recalls Abbas Kiarostami’s ', '. We also see Heshmat vacuum his elderly mother’s entire apartment, tenderly dye his wife’s hair after helping her pick out the right color, and being an example of honesty at the local grocery store. It isn’t until we’ve grown completely accustomed to the idea that there is no “catch” to this portrait of family life in Iran that Rasoulof punches us in the gut with a flawlessly timed denouement.', 'The jolt is at once affective and intellectual, as you may feel as if you understand the film in an instant, as an uncompromising exposure of the banality of evil, then spend the rest of it nursing your shock. It’s clever for Rasoulof to not use the structure of the first segment, with its last-minute narrative blow, as a model for the ones that follow. Rather, ', ' takes the shape of a filmic anthology, as if multiple directors with distinct sensibilities had been asked to share their musings on the same topic: the various shapes that guilt and honor (or lack thereof) might take in a context of state-sanctioned death. Through this chameleonic approach, Rasoulof unravels the various conceptual threads that emerge from the first story with shorts that are still full of suspense and mystery but that allow us to situate ourselves much sooner, and as such participate in the drama in a more cerebral fashion.', 'In another impeccably orchestrated segment, we find a soldier, Pouya (Kaveh Ahangar), wallowing in despair as he awaits the order to execute his first prisoner. The story evokes Dostoevsky, as our reluctant hero spends the night with his barrack mates discussing the many ways he can escape his predicament, all of which seem to lead to a dead end still teeming with some fatal injustice. It’s just a question of who will end up pulling the trigger, or pushing the stool, in a world where all bodies are marked to either slay or be slayed.', 'The ending here is also shocking. Not because it suddenly illuminates a crucial blind spot in our understanding of the story, but due to its unexpected playfulness. The idea of captive life already being a kind of death takes shape through a sudden genre transition when the film surrenders to the lightheartedness of a musical. As reunited lovers sing the Italian resistance song “Bella Ciao” in a getaway car in a moment of ecstatic euphoria, the taste of freedom becomes the only experience worth seeking—whatever the cost, and however brief.', ' ', ' Baran Rasoulof, Shahi Jila, Kaveh Ahangar, Darya Moghbeli, Shaghayegh Shoorian, Mahtab Servati, Mohammad Valizadegan, Ehsan Mirhosseini, Alireza Zareparast, Mohammad Seddighimehr, Salar Khamseh, Reza Bahrami, Pouya Mehri, Kaveh Ebrahim ', ' Mohammad Rasoulof ', ' Mohammad Rasoulof ', ' 150 min ', ' NR ', ' 2020', 'The film allows that we are complicit in privilege for our fascination and envy.', 'Published', 'on', 'By', 'iven the current polarization of political discourse, it’s become easy for filmmakers to satirize the rich as monsters.

What’s missing from the fashionable preaching of these productions (partially exempting ', ') is wickedness, a sense that we’re learning something we didn’t already know, or are perhaps forging a risky kinship with characters who should theoretically repel us. In this context, ', ' offers a naughty thrill, as director Giuseppe Capotondi and screenwriter Scott B. Smith establish an atmosphere of rarefied debauchery, which they allow to hang in the air for a surprisingly extended amount of time, until springing a rushed third act.', 'Adapted from Charles Willeford’s novel of the same name, ', ' is a form of revenge exacted upon critics. In Milan, an art critic, James Figueras (Claes Bang), delivers a lecture, promoting a book he’s written tellingly called ', '. James discusses a primitive-looking yet bold painting involving yellows and slashing gestures, which he initially writes off before switching gears with an elaborate story of loss that inspired the artist to create it. After this tale, the audience is ready to buy prints of the work, until James confesses that he’s lying; he himself painted it thoughtlessly. James has asserted his power as a critic, as a conveyor of meaning, to arouse interest in something without value.', 'This scene is intercut with moments in which James practices his lecture in a bathroom, a device that emphasizes the contrivance of his performance. James, then, has broken a cardinal rule of criticism that many critics are tempted to violate: to not dictate the terms of art-making. James’s elitism is so pronounced that he feels that virtually no one can tell the difference between “real” and “fake” art, and so he will take it upon himself to dictate reality in order to sell his writing and perhaps future derivative paintings, which he can render “good” through the power of his erudition, rationalizing, and gift for myth-making. James is a frustrated creative, like Lee Israel in Marielle Heller’s ', ', who illustrates the potentially murky boundary separating the politics of the art industry from fraudulence. James has come to utilize notions of reputation and canon, which are complicated and dependent on class and power anyway, as bolsters of an elaborate shell game.', 'Bang is at ease with James’s un-likeability—and his confidence is among ', '’s most reliable pleasures. As in BBC’s recent, uneven ', ' miniseries, Bang emits here an aura of boredom, intelligence, and mild amusement that could mask an abyss of cruelty; his handsomeness and peerless diction are subtly menacing. As such, we feel protective of Berenice Hollis (Elizabeth Debecki), a young woman who meets James at this lecture and quickly sleeps with him. Berenice also presents herself as tough, but Debecki allows you to feel Berenice’s effort, there’s nothing of James’s bitterness in her. Soon, they’re in Lake Como at the sprawling country home of art gallery owner Joseph Cassidy (Mick Jagger), where James could land the assignment of a lifetime: an exclusive interview with reclusive artist Jerome Debney (Donald Sutherland), a man of mystery who lives in a studio on Joseph’s estate. Joseph wants James to wrangle from the old man something he can sell.', 'Capotondi and Smith don’t allow this mother lode of backstory to overwhelm the film, as they whittle it down to a series of verbal duels, in which James, Joseph, and Jerome debate the semantics of art and art-creation against the gorgeous backdrop of Joseph’s estate. ', ', the title of which is a despairing parody of critical pretension, is essentially a sun-dappled essay on male egocentrism. And, unlike many recent greed parables, it bothers to empathize with the draw of wielding power, of keeping the company of gorgeous and charismatic young women, and of walking into a room knowing everyone inside wants what you have. In other words, the film allows that we are complicit in privilege for our fascination and envy, and Jagger’s stunt casting opposite of Bang is an especial masterstroke.', 'Jagger is, of course, far more successful than even his character, and here he radiates an effortless cynicism and self-satisfaction, barely papered over with courtesy, which is deeply amusing and resonant. Joseph is a commanding, charismatic embodiment of privilege, and Jagger’s svelte wielding of his own legend-hood serves to put the comparatively unknown Bang up on his figurative haunches, a relationship between actors which embodies viscerally the relationship between their characters. James is a wannabe, whereas Joseph is a player.', 'Sutherland offers the audience a reprieve from the film’s central big-dick contest, giving Jerome a courtly decency that testifies to the optimism that can drive artistic creation, which can get lost among the politics of distribution, accumulation, and analysis. The truth of Jerome’s current artistic output isn’t a surprise, and it leads to acts of violence that are common of thrillers, somewhat compromising the film’s lingering, mysterious air of possibility. This routine plotting is a disappointment coming from Smith, who wrote the novel ', ' as well as its screenplay adaptation, both of which tracked terrifyingly plausible descents into violence. However, ', ' ends on a lovely, bittersweet note, in which a piece of art finds an audience of one, who regards it with nothing more or less than the piercing human love that led to its very creation.', ' ', ' Claes Bang, Elizabeth Debicki, Mick Jagger, Donald Sutherland, Rosalind Halstead, Alessandro Fabrizi ', ' Giuseppe Capotondi ', ' Scott B.

', 'Maybe it’s my general aversion to Nascar, or anything chiefly targeted at below-the-line states. Maybe it’s that Larry the Cable Guy’s Mater is the Jar Jar Binks of animated film. Or maybe it’s just that a routinely plotted movie about talking cars is miles beneath Pixar’s proven level of ingenuity, not to mention artistry (okay, we’ll give those handsome heartland vistas a pass). Whatever the coffin nail, ', ', if not its utterly needless sequel, is thus far the tepid, petroleum-burning nadir of the Pixar brand, the first of the studio’s films to feel like it’s not just catering, but kowtowing, to a specific demographic. Having undeservedly spawned more merchandising than a movie that’s literally about toys, ', '’s cold commercialism can still be felt today, with a just-launched theme park at Disneyland. And while CG people are hardly needed to give a Pixar film humanity, it’s perhaps telling that this, one of the animation house’s few fully anthropomorphic efforts, is also its least humane. ', ' has poignant moments, particularly when a human boy teaches Arlo, the titular protagonist, how to swim in a river, and there are funny allusions to how pitiless animals in the wild can be. But the film abounds in routine, featherweight episodes that allow the hero to predictably prove his salt to his family, resembling a cross between ', ' and ', '. There’s barely a villain, little ambiguity, and essentially no stakes. There isn’t much of a hero either. Arlo is a collection of insecurities that have been calculatedly assembled so as to teach children the usual lessons about bravery, loyalty, and self-sufficiency. ', ' is the sort of bland holiday time-killer that exhausted parents might describe as “cute” as a way of evading their indifference to it. Children might not settle for it either, and one shouldn’t encourage them to. ', 'It’s perfectly fair to walk into ', ' with a wince, wondering what ', ' hath wrought, and lamenting the fact that even Pixar has fallen into Hollywood’s post-recession safe zone of sequel mania and brand identification. What’s ostensibly worse, ', ' jumps on the prequel, origin-story bandwagon, suggesting our sacred CGI dream machine has even been touched by—gulp—the superhero phenomenon. But, while admittedly low on the Pixar totem pole, ', ' proves a vibrant and compassionate precursor to ', ', the kid-friendly film that, to boot, helped to quell bedroom fears. Tracing Mike and Sulley’s paths from ill-matched peers to super scarers, ', ' boasts Pixar’s trademark attention to detail (right down to abstract modern sculptures on the quad), and it manages to bring freshness to the underdog tale, which is next to impossible these days. ', ' is content to explore the end of Lightning McQueen’s (Owen Wilson) career with a series of pre-packaged sports-film clichés—an old dog trying to learn new tricks, struggling with a sport that seems to have passed him by, and facing, for the first time in his career, a sense of vulnerability. The template turns out to be a natural fit for the ', ' universe, organically integrating racing into the fabric of the film and rendering it with a visceral sense of speed, excitement, and struggle. Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo) is a welcome addition, a plucky foil to McQueen who’s also a three-dimensional presence in her own right, much more richly developed than one-joke characters like Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) and Luigi (Tony Shalhoub). Cruz’s presence also allows the filmmakers to bring some social conscience to this sometimes backward-looking franchise, exploring the discouraging pressures placed on young female athletes while also nodding toward the historical exclusion of women and racial minorities from racing. ', 'For those who waited patiently for the first Pixar film to be led by a female protagonist, it’s understandable that ', ' might have been a disappointment, arriving after the studio hit its artistic peak, and suffering from a handful of authorship woes. But the feminist fable remains the most underrated of this revered brand’s lot, not least because of Princess Merida’s eye-popping head full of aptly unruly hair. The movie may enchant with its focus on Scottish lore (an element arguably explored better in ', '), and it may deserve a hand for its girl-power, who-needs-a-husband trajectory, but the distincitve bit that puts the lump in your throat is the mother-daughter story. From ', ' to ', ', ', ' to ', ', princess tales almost always deal with the heroine’s link to a father or an evil mother surrogate, never an actual mom who imposes relatable, resonant rules. This far more interesting dichotomy gives ', ' an especially fresh and expressly female perspective. And while Merida’s mother’s transformation into a bear may seem gonzo and random, it’s actually perfectly appropriate: Together, mother and daughter must fight to undo a beast of a burden, one that’s historically, symbolically masculine in nature. ', ' doesn’t have a distinctive visual style, but it does showcase Pixar’s trademark mastery of depth, light, and shadow. As in Dan Scanlon’s ', ', the fanciful and the everyday are well harmonized. That’s still a neat trick, but it’s no more novel than Ian (Tom Holland) and Barley’s (Chris Pratt) experiences. Animated features often borrow from other films, in part to keep the grown-ups in the crowd interested, but the way ', ' recalls at various points ', ', ', ', and ', ' feels perfunctory and uninspired. And it all leads to a moral that’s at least as hoary as that of ', ' or ', '. While ', ' begins as a story of bereavement, it soon turns to celebrating the payoffs of positive thinking. That you can accomplish whatever you believe you can is a routine movie message, but it can feel magical when presented with more imagination than ', ' ever musters. ', 'The gentle counterpart to Dreamworks Animation’s ', ', ', ' deals in a wealth of familiar themes and narratives, peddling the importance of community inherent to ant populations, positioning unlikely hero Flik as a fish out of water when he seeks help for the colony, and reinforcing the tyke-targeted notion that “being small isn’t so bad” (a maxim preached to young ant Dot, voiced by a very young Hayden Panettiere). But when Flik, a “country bug,” goes searching for warriors to combat the ants’ oppressive grasshopper nemeses, and instead returns with a ragtag troupe of circus insects (think the gang from ', ' performing amid the carnival debris of ', '), a more intriguing theme emerges. As the actors and acrobats help the ants to craft a massive bird (a salvation-bringing idol that will hopefully scare off the enemy), they also introduce art as an alternative to fear and violence, and the film presents entertainment as something not just diverting, but heroic. ', 'Driven by the potency of its social intentions, Eliza Hittman’s film is so authentically felt that it becomes hyper-real.', 'Published', 'on', 'By', 'liza Hittman’s ', ', a slice of life in a neorealist vein, is a bravura depiction of the social barriers that get in the way of women asserting their agency. Quiet and perpetually dressed in a hoodie, 17-year-old Autumn (Sidney Flanigan) is first glimpsed at her Pennsylvania high school’s ‘50s-style talent show performing a cover of the Exciters’s 1963 hit “He Got the Power,” whose lyrics include “He makes me do things I don’t want to do/He makes me say things I don’t want to say.” Between this, the barbershop quartet at the ready, and the students dressed as Elvis Presley, Hittman pointedly ironizes an ostensibly enlightened present’s nostalgia for a regressive past.', 'Autumn is increasingly detached from her family, including her mother (Sharon Van Etten). She only really connects with her cousin, Skylar (Talia Ryder), with whom she works at a grocery store where everyone, including their manager, leers at them. Soon, a pregnancy test confirms what Autumn had already suspected. We don’t know who the father is, and that doesn’t really matter. After reading a few adoption pamphlets, and trying to induce a miscarriage by brutally punching her belly, Autumn decides to have an abortion. But there’s one problem: In Pennsylvania, a parent is required to give permission for an underage person to have the procedure. And so Skylar and Autumn steal from the cash register at work and grab a Greyhound to New York together, where an abortion should be slightly easier to obtain.', 'After the bus soars past post-industrial Pennsylvania and heads into a tunnel, plunging ', ' into momentary darkness, we’re teleported to Manhattan, and the effect is nothing less than electric, redolent of the entry into the Zone from Andrei Tarkovsky’s ', '. Hélène Louvart’s 16mm cinematography never smacks of easy nostalgia, as there’s a distinctly modern quality to the grain and flattened colors of the film’s images. There’s a limber quality to the handheld camerawork, a delicacy to the way it almost seems to caress characters’ faces. As envisioned here, New York suggests an alien world, the shallow focus reducing figures on busy sidewalks to glowing shapes of various colors.', 'Plagued by setbacks, Autumn and Skylar have to stay in the city overnight, and as they have no money for a hotel, they’re forced to sleep inside bus and subway stations. It’s as if the city is turning against them, but when they find a late-night arcade, there’s a pointedness to the kaleidoscopic presentation of the scene. Here, Hittman’s sensuous filmmaking stands in sharp contrast to the harshness of the subject matter, as she neither loses sight of the miserable nature of Autumn and Skylar’s situation nor their desires for more than just security. These are two very normal girls, and their ordinariness, as they struggle to navigate spaces that are built for men to stare at women from behind one-sided mirrors, or to trap them behind a cash desk, underscores the life they can’t have. But the arcade, with its ', ' machine and Tic-Tac-Toe-playing chicken, still offers them a kind of escape.', 'Hittman’s dreamy coming-of-age stories at times suggest something from the Larry Clark school of provocation, where a certain penchant for transgression comes at the expense of verisimilitude. But the strength of this film is that its transgression comes from the shock of how the abortion system works. How each thing that ostensibly keeps people safe is harmful in a different way. Use your invaluable health insurance, and the procedure will show up on your parents’ statement. Spend the stolen cash to pay for it instead and you can’t buy a ticket home. This approach might be didactic at times, but Hittman’s screenplay manages to capture the interlocking effects of wider, separate issues with impeccable precision. Medicare for all, toxic masculinity, the working class, pro-lifers, homelessness, and privatization of public space—all are gestured to without moralizing or pontificating. It’s all in service of character.', 'The political centerpiece of the film is the scene that gives it its title, in which Autumn is made to respond to “personal questions” with the answers “never,” “rarely,” “sometimes,” or “always.” It’s then that she can go through with her abortion. All of the questions involve increasingly violent situations with men. And in one elongated close-up, the extent of Autumn’s experiences to date are painfully suggested across her face. “I want to make sure you’re safe,” says the counselor, who’s literally only looking to check the right boxes and send Autumn on her merry way. Driven by the potency of its social intentions, ', ' is so authentically felt that it becomes hyper-real, a nightmarish disquisition about how entire systems are rigged against women that would feel academic if it didn’t play out against earnest performances of tender teenage emotions.', ' ', ' Sidney Flanigan, Talia Ryder, Théodore Pellerin, Ryan Eggold, Sharon Van Etten ', ' Eliza Hittman ', ' Eliza Hittman ', ' Focus Features ', ' 101 min ', ' PG-13 ', ' 2020', 'It’s difficult to imagine a more socially engaged or powerful condemnation of the exploitative gig economy than Ken Loach’s latest.', 'Published', 'on', 'By', 't’s difficult to imagine a more socially engaged or powerful condemnation of the exploitative gig economy than Ken Loach’s ', ', which places the viewer on the ground with an English family trudging through the muck left behind by the erosion of workers’ rights in Europe. Here, the supposed economy of free choice promulgated by neoliberal policies manifests as a domestic realm in which one’s job penetrates into every waking moment, leaving stressed bodies and minds with no time and little wherewithal for a personal life or obligations. Global forces control the fate of the family at the story’s center, in ways not immediately apparent on the individual or family level. As Ricky (Kris Hitchen) plaintively puts it late in the film, “It just seems to me that everything is out of wack.”', 'The fulcrum on which Ricky’s life teeters is the small black scanner he carries with him as a delivery person for a private parcel service. The all-powerful scanner tracks the packages he rushes to destinations around his former mining town, as well as Ricky himself, keeping him synchronized to a precise delivery schedule that he can be punished severely for falling behind on. The black box itself also constitutes a symbol of his extreme employment precarity, as the company he works for (the fictional PDF) supplies him with one of the expensive machines, and he would be on the hook for a thousand pounds if it were to be broken or lost.', 'Through the device of the scanner, Loach and screenwriter Paul Laverty no doubt intentionally evoke the bicycle from Vittorio De Sica’s ', '. They revealingly suggest that the gig economy promises little more but a return to pre-prosperity conditions for Europe’s working class, sold under the pretense of expanded autonomy and opportunity. Though Ricky answers both to the black box and Maloney (Ross Brewster), an imposing, unforgiving boss, he ostensibly serves as a “franchisee,” the owner of his own business and master of his own destiny—the overt scam by which large companies like Uber circumvent labor laws and outsource the costs of operation to their employees (sorry, “independent contractors”).', ' you opens with Maloney explaining the job in such terms to Ricky, but, piece by piece, the film rends apart the image constructed by Maloney’s con-man pitch. In Loach’s unadorned, social-realist style, we see Ricky’s life begin to crumble as anxieties mount: the behavioral issues of his teenage son, Seb (Rhys Stone), are exacerbated by Ricky’s increased hours away from home; his daughter, Liza (Katie Proctor), still a tender 11 years old, suppresses the trauma of the family’s increasingly tension-filled lives; and Ricky is progressively alienated from his beloved wife, Abbie (Debbie Honeywood), whose perpetual self-sacrifice at work and home seems to be for naught. The six-day-a-week job Ricky needs to survive proves lacking in any of the flexibility that would allow him to address these compounding family crises and any of the protections that would facilitate recovery from his work-borne fatigue and the acts of God that eventually beset him.', 'The viewer accompanies Ricky on his deliveries, showing the day-to-day difficulties a courier copes with in dealing with a broad range of individuals caught up in their own world and oblivious to his. But Loach also devotes stretches of the film to other members of the family; most prominently, the film speaks to the current labor market’s degradation of human dignity through Abbie’s struggle to work while keeping her family together, stable, and healthy. Abbie cares for elderly hospice patients, making in-home visits to keep them company and assist them in moving, eating, and using the restroom—for which she’s paid a mere pittance and, like Ricky, must contend with a dehumanizing management that perpetually pushes her work hours into her family time. Through Abbie’s conversations with Mollie (Heather Wood), one of her patients and a former labor organizer, that Loach and Laverty deliver the reminder that the battles that need to be fought today have been waged before—and won.', 'The characters, each wearied by the constant stress of this economy are played with an understated realism that’s startling in the context of the typical melodrama through which poverty and social crises are usually addressed. To Loach, social problems cannot be distilled into melodrama’s abstractions, as the dignity in labor and life slipping out of the characters’ worlds stems from their material conditions, not from inner psychological states or idealist values. One could describe Loach’s depiction of the disintegration of this working-class family unit as emotionally devastating—and it absolutely is—but to leave it there would be to miss the point.

The older man (Lee), in turn, is seen taking a bath, stretching his sore body in the woods, and staring out a window for what feels like an entire afternoon, as he listens to the sound of water.

And in such moments as Lee’s character sitting in a chair and looking intently at an off-camera window for a long stretch of time, an entire film unfolds across his face.

And while there’s no talking in ', ', there’s plenty of sleeping. Naps on top of rickety mattresses or hotel room beds that recall Melanie Schiff’s “Sleeping Boy” photo series, in the ominous ways these images of sleep suggest symptoms rather than the body’s clockwork going through its motions.

Afterward, the older man hands the younger one his cash payment and, then, almost forgetting it, in the way we tend to forget the most important detail of a recounted dream precisely because that’s where its uncomfortable crux lies, he reaches for something in his suitcase: a gift he offers to the masseur before he departs. It’s a small music box, which the young man, touched by the gesture, is quick to wind so he can finally listen to what he has to say, even if by proxy.', 'It’s easy to feel as if the film’s pathos begins to slip through Tsai’s fingers as we listen to the melancholy song produced by the music box. On screen, such a memento is often used as a symbol for sorrow, and as such would appear to be at odds with the director’s penchant for ambiguity. Yet Tsai is quick to deliver us from hackneyed territory by having the young man wind the music box again and again and again, turning the prop into something else altogether. Something that allows the unsayable in all of its banality to finally be expressed.

Whether they’re furnishing vendor carts in the German countryside (', ') or attempting to reestablish an identity in the wake of World War II (', '), Petzold’s characters seem to cling to romance as a stabilizing force in turbulent times. Though at once lighter and stranger than any of his earlier work, ', ' makes the melodramatic trappings of the director’s previous films its explicit subject, questioning the fixed nature of human behavior in a world whose borders are constantly shifting.', 'It’s ironic and puzzling, then, that ', '’s eponymous character is both human and a water sprite. The film’s opening shot is fixed on the electric orange curls of Undine’s (Paula Beer) hair as she sits, downcast, at an outdoor café. She’s being dumped by her wealthy boyfriend, Johannes (Jacob Matschenz), an affront that she attempts to combat with semantics. When this fails, she tells him, “If you leave me, I’ll have to kill you. You know that.” This is a succinct enough summary of the myth ', ' takes as its source text, in which a sprite is given human life after she falls in love with a man who she insists must remain faithful to her.', 'Petzold shoots that breakup in a tight shot-reverse shot sequence, emphasizing the bland, molded sympathy of Johannes and Undine’s alert, probing micro-expressions. The scene’s realism is interrupted twice: by a church bell that elicits both a tear from Undine and a slight, spectral rising of music on the soundtrack; and by the flip phone that Undine opens to reexamine a recent voicemail. As this typically compact but deceptively rich film moves along, such flashes of dislocation proliferate, undermining ', '’s seemingly contemporary setting and leaving us to wonder whether love and logic are compatible.', 'The film gambols between tones from the outset, rushing Undine, a historian who traces the expansion of Berlin over centuries, to a presentation on local architecture and then back to the café where, hoping that Johannes has changed his mind and opted to stay with her, she meets Christoph (Franz Rogowski), a goofy industrial diver who fixes bridges and dams. Their mutual relationship to both the water and industrial infrastructure is sanctified in a meet-cute involving a broken aquarium and a whispered voice from another realm. Christoph and Undine’s love—a romance that plays out like a piece of mystical/screwball fan fiction for ', ' obsessives agonized by that film’s fateful vicissitudes—instantly feels complete.', 'While ', ' luxuriates in the gushiness of Christoph and Undine’s mutual attraction, Petzold also takes pains to frame his romance around Berlin’s evolution from a modest trading hub to a locus of international division to, finally (or at least for now), a mirror of the urban creep of gentrification and fad economies. (It’s worth noting that the café Undine returns to repeatedly is housed in an old church.) And this commentary takes the form of lectures delivered by Undine at the Senate for Urban Development and Housing, in a room dominated by scale models depicting Berlin’s sprawl over the past few centuries.', 'Her speech on the Berlin Palace, an imperial hub dating back to 1443 that was destroyed 500 years later and is currently being rebuilt to house a museum, refers to the “phantom pain of a violent amputation” that must be reclaimed in a modern context. “Progress is impossible,” she hypothesizes, but individuals and the broader public nonetheless long to make a performance of healing. This poignant speech is one of the few moments where Undine seems to obliquely reference her identity as a once- or semi-aquatic creature. Petzold’s concise narrative has plenty on its mind, but it’s challenging to reconcile the fantastic nature of his premise with the relative lack of importance it attaches to Undine’s actions or philosophy.', 'Progress, like romance, moves in cycles, and Undine’s speech augurs the return of Johannes to her psyche. Their chance meeting opens up a rupture in Christoph and Undine’s heretofore unalloyed mutual affection, and as Petzold ushers his lovers toward doom, the film almost seems to rewind, revisiting most of its settings and turning sites of passion into mausoleums of aching and regret. “Form follows function,” Undine says in one of her presentations,” and with minor alterations in framing and presentation Petzold fundamentally shifts our sense of these locations.

Maybe I missed something, but \'Onward\' just didn\'t do that for me. The message was a little lost. Was it that I should love my siblings? (I know. My mum used to tell me every day) or maybe it was that people who take gap years aren\'t dropkicks? If you\'re an introvert, wait until you learn magic and then everyone will accept you?\r\n', ""\r\nPixar usually gets the award for simple storytelling done splendidly. Still waters run deep - and you realise, diving into their stories, there is so much to analyse. Ironically, 'Onward' doesn't have that magic behind it.

This is the Pixar edition of 'Trolls'. It's the one that got away, because it wasn't intended to make us (adults) happy.

Some of the set pieces, such as the Lightfoot home or the Manticore Tavern — which is transformed into a Chuck E. Cheese/Dave & Buster’s establishment — are fully realized and inventive. The filmmakers conducted their fantasy lore research thoroughly to bring this fantasy world to life and deliver some really funny jokes, incorporating elements from contemporary suburban society and applying it to the fantasy world.\xa0', 'Do I need to express how incredible the animation is? It just goes without saying. It’s Pixar. They are top tier when it comes to quality animation.

Instead of having a lion mane (like most manticores), she has short curly hair. I loved those small details.', 'At its core, so much of the narrative weighs on the shoulders of the brothers and their journey. While the quest itself is small-scale and disappointingly simplistic, it’s the dynamic of Ian and Barley that makes this narrative effective. You have a neurotic and anxious 16-year-old and his 18-year-old slacker brother who is a fantasy fanatic, which in this world would be probably considered a traditionalist. The dynamic between them is effective in both the comedy and the emotional drama. It’s the major strength of the story and they’re both endearing, especially Ian who feels the weight of loneliness while wishing to meet the dad he never knew, and it just hits you in the feels. Most of the emotional beats stem from Ian and the subtle moments with him move you to tears. When the brothers are on screen together, you feel so much of that familial bond in how they look out for each other, capturing that genuine brotherly love, and it really resonates with you.\xa0\xa0', 'The aforementioned quest itself is pretty basic. A large portion of the movie becomes a road trip, which I’m personally getting tired of since road trip movies follow such a basic formula.

It doesn’t have anything to do with Chris Pratt’s performance because he does a really good job. I think it’s in his nature. Barley is a traditionalist of sorts, for he’s obsessed with how creatures behaved in the old days and he abides by a fantasy game, which he thinks of as a bible of sorts, and it did get under my skin for the first half of the movie. But as the film progresses, you get used to his personality and feel for him. He still shows nothing but love for his younger brother and is pretty wise at times.\xa0', 'We gotta stop holding Pixar to such a high standard for every single original feature.

It’s very good, especially for families.\xa0', 'You guys got a letterboxd, I made a video.'], ['A Film-Focused Digital Online Zine', 'Pixar has been in quite a slump as of recently. In the past decade, there’s been a significant downgrade in quality, in terms of their production of feature film work. Producing largely sequel based products for nostalgia driven adults and children alike, the original heart and intent of Pixar has suddenly gone away. What used to be a studio which was world renowned for its universal stories of family, adolescence, and universal morals, has officially turned corporate with the dominated Disney merger. Of course there’s the occasional banger, with ', ' and ', ' though the 2010’s for Pixar pales in comparison with their early 2000’s work; where the team truly shined through with masterpiece on top of masterpiece.\xa0', 'Commencing a new decade, Pixar’s latest feature ', ' may have not been the greatest film to start a new renaissance for the now creatively failing studio. ', 'is by no means an awful film, or even egregiously convoluted against the likes of ', 'or even ', '. Though that doesn’t automatically make it one of the studio’s finest pieces to date. In some ways, over the past few years, the writing team has become frequently lazy with their storytelling. Ripping off identical story beats from earlier and better films, most Disney Animation and Pixar flicks have become increasingly predictable and redundant. These story beats include the obligatory separation of the two main protagonists at the end of the second act, the constant stating of the obvious, the nauseatingly unnecessary epilogue, and the heartfelt `family” resolution. For the first time ever, Pixar has broken their record of the amount of cliches and tropes used in ONE film with their latest feature ', '.\xa0', 'Outside of the predictability factor however, is a beautifully charming story of brotherhood. The dynamic between the two leads Ian and Barley is frankly refreshing; especially when the “reckless senior” cliche (in this case the character of Chris Pratt’s Barley) isn’t overdone, and instead done humanely so. In most cases, there would be some sort of retaliation between the two brothers about Ian’s magical powers. Thankfully, Barley doesn’t go through with this typical annoying shtick, and instead is honestly portrayed as a supportive older “parental” sibling to his younger brother. It’s a refreshing change of place, which adds a sense of subverted expectations in a story that’s already filled with numerous familiar story beats.\xa0', 'As with most Pixar flicks, ', ' is undeniably gorgeous in it’s hyper realistic backdrops and simplistic character designs. The rendering and lighting is in full force with their Renderman Pixar software they’ve meticulously programmed over the past couple of years. Pixar’s primary goal from it’s initial inception was to innovate; to further prove the great lengths of computer generated imagery. With ', ', advancements were clearly made on a technical scale. It’s just that one can’t say the same with the rest of the project, with its meandering narrative, average voice performances, and audaciously irritating musical score.\xa0', 'I’ve grown consistently disappointed in Pixar. There was a time where I was thrilled to watch one of their new features; expecting the best of the best from one of the greatest animation houses ever to exist. Now, it seems as though Iger and other corporate identities have infiltrated the writing rooms, and have replaced any real stakes, tension, or even motivation in their current and future projects. The majority of Pixar’s films feel unnecessary. While ', ' does have some sort of significant purpose in it’s own existence, it’s a film that ultimately retreads similar themes and motifs from superior Pixar joints. Remarkably charming though hollow in it’s narrative skeleton, ', ' is nothing more than a Disney product with a heart of gold.\xa0', 'Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Google account.\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Twitter account.\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Facebook account.\t\t\t', '\n\t\t\t', '\n\t\t', 'Connecting to %s', ' ', ' ', ' ', '\n', '\n', '\n\t\t\tFreelance writer based in Ottawa Ontario.\t\t\t', '\n\t\t'], ['\n        ', '\n\n    ', '\n  ', '\n        ', '\n\n    ', '\n  ', '\n        ', '\n\n    ', '\n  ', '\n        ', '\n\n    ', '\n  ', '\n        ', '\n\n    ', '\n  ', '\n        ', '\n\n    ', '\n  ', '\n        ', '\n\n    ', '\n  ', '\n        ', '\n\n    ', '\n  ', '\n        ', '\n\n    ', '\n  ', 'Sign in to report inappropriate content.\n', '\n        ', '\n\n    ', '\n  ', '\n        ', '\n\n    ', '\n  ', '\n        ', '\n\n    ', '\n  ', 'Before you tell me I’m wrong, I liked ONWARD, but I didn’t love the latest film from Disney/Pixar.

A teen boy recites a spell trying to bring his father back to life for a day; a stone glows in a magic staff and bolts of energy flash illuminating the feet and legs of a man to the waist as they regenerate; the boy loses his grip on the staff and the stone shatters ending the spell (we see the partially generated person stand up from under a pile of clothes).', '\n', '\xa0A teen boy drives van and speeds onto highway traffic: they are chased by pixies riding motorcycles and one rider swings a chain that wraps around the boy’s hand and nearly pulls him out of the van, several pixies jump on the boy’s face and cause him to swerve among other cars and trucks and he eventually exits the highway as the motorcycles crash into construction barrels (we see no injuries). Two teens in a van are chased by police cars across a field and along a narrow path; they stop and rig their van to cause a boulder to fall on the path to block the police cars and we see the van crushed under a huge boulder (we see no injuries).

Yet because of the Pixar name, we have blind faith regardless. The concept is a zany one: After two blue elf brothers conjure the bottom half of their deceased dad in a spell gone awry, they’re forced to go on a quest to obtain a magical stone that will fully restore him for one day. However, once director Dan Scanlon and company delve deeper into the premise, they find genuine profundity.', 'This percolating potion of humor and heart casts a magical spell, garnering a well-earned emotional pull fueled by a highly resonant wish-fulfillment fantasy. The filmmakers have carefully crafted a heartrending love letter to the magic of rediscovery and the latent powers our legacies hold. It’s essentially Pixar’s ABOUT TIME if Richard Curtis had set his film in an animated magical realm populated with mythical creatures. Get ready to ugly cry – especially those who’ve lost someone near and dear.', 'The fantasy world of the story was once brimming with magic and optimism until convenience took over and technology replaced sorcery. Fast forward to “modern times,” where teen elf Ian Lightfoot (voiced by Tom Holland) is struggling with a lack of confidence and looking for a guiding light. Since his dad passed away many years prior, Ian’s caring single mother Laurel (voiced by Julia Louis Dreyfus) shoulders the responsibility. Still, even she can only say or do so much. And his older brother Barley (voiced by Chris Pratt) isn’t much help either as he’s an oafish slacker without much direction in his own life. It would seem Ian is trapped in hopeless adolescence. ', 'On Ian’s 16th birthday, he receives a wizard staff as a gift from his long-deceased father with instructions on how to bring him back to life for a day. Though Barley sputters get it to work, Ian’s got the gift to release the wooden rod’s power. Still, the unwitting mage’s latent skills only take the spell so far – waist high, to be precise – conjuring their pops’ khaki-clad legs and brown loafer-sporting feet. This leads the two and a half men on a once-in-a-lifetime journey, a day-long road trip in Barley’s busted Dodge van, to unearth another crystal to properly finish the incantation. ', 'Scanlon, Jason Headley and Keith Bunin’s screenplay functions at its best when it’s leaning into sincerity over silliness. While sequences that showcase the brothers bonding over sticky situations are laced with sweet undertones (like their confrontation with a bitchy biker fairy gang at a rest stop, or getting cornered by the authorities), they are slanted a bit more towards the comedic aspects. Occasionally, the filmmakers slightly undercut a poignant moment when a transitional breather could be an asset. Barley’s heartfelt confession about an upsetting memory involving his illness-stricken dad is an unexpected, extremely cathartic gut-punch – one that’s undeniable for those who’ve gone through similar situations. That vulnerability plays pitch-perfectly in Pratt’s vocal intonations. Yet, the authentic earnestness of the scene quickly gives way to the absurdity of the enlarged cheese puff they’re floating on instead of giving the emotion a second to gracefully land. That said, dealing with devastating personal loss is like that – sometimes, the only thing to pull one out of all-encompassing sadness is the absurd, awkward nature of when and where it chooses to strike. So there’s a very real, palpable validity to this scene, even set in an unreal environment.', 'In addition to the filmmakers’ forward-thinking approach to dealing with grief, they approach traditional character archetypes with just as much innovation. It’s wildly refreshing that Laurel isn’t relegated to staying at home, worrying and waiting by the phone. She’s not boxed into the stereotypical “wife” or “mom” role. She takes charge, tailing her boys while also learning to rediscover her inner warrior. Qualities like Barley’s encyclopedic knowledge of quests and spells, which would usually marginalize him as an outcast, are viewed as strengths in terms of the narrative context. Third stringers like Manticore (voiced by Octavia Spencer), a bat-winged bear beast with a scorpion tail working through an identity crisis, and Officer Colt Bronco (voiced by Mel Rodriguez), Laurel’s centaur boyfriend attempting to forge a relationship with her boys, also augment thematic ties. ', 'Perhaps the best thing that Scanlon’s film does is that it gives audiences of all ages (but especially young kids) the tools to work through sorrow in a safe space. It becomes the message in a bottle we desire to hear from a lost loved one: that all of us have the potential to unlock a little bit of magic of our own.

It’s basically a mirror of our society, but if we gave up on a magical element from ages past as we progressed in terms of technology. ', 'General setup aside, this is about an epic quest as the brothers discover that magic is indeed real. They accomplish this by opening a gift from their late father and bringing back just his legs. From there, it’s a journey of self-discovery and growth as they aim to spend a day with the full version of him. There are of course many trials as they pursue this adventure, and this is basically at typical sort of road trip. It definitely carries some unique surprises, and they play with some interesting concepts throughout.

It’s an almost simple journey as things progress, but they certainly go far in terms of distance.', ' There are some fun surprises, good laughs to be had and unique uses of magic.

Although both brothers are focused on getting bonding time with Wilden, the movie is really about the connection between brothers, and specifically about Ian learning to appreciate Barley, for all his goofy, unrestrained exuberance.

It’s not too far of a stretch from his Peter Parker/Spider-Man role, and his comfort and familiarity with this type of character are reflected in his performance. Pratt delivers a wonderfully endearing, goofy, and hilarious performance as Barley. It had a very Andy Dwyer-esque vibe, which was very entertaining and fits perfectly for the endearing yet sometimes disappointing Barley. With his Marvel transformation, I have to say Pratt’s comedy has been on a different wavelength, and it was an absolute pleasure to see Pratt inhabit a more goofy and shlubby character that he just can’t pull of with his current physique. Julia Louis-Dreyfus does a wonderful job as a doting yet strong mother to the boys.

It's ironic that the action is set in a world that is suffering from exactly that problem, as the elves, sprites and unicorns that inhabit it have let technology take over their lives. The result is that they have forgotten what magic they had - so centaurs, for example, drive about in cars and sprites fly around on motorbikes rather than use their wings."", ""This is where shy Ian (Tom Holland) lives with his mum (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and his doofus brother Barley (Chris Pratt) since their dad died before Ian was born and when Barley was tiny.

In plotting terms, it's decidedly complicated and that's part of the problem.

Where would you be willing to journey? What tasks would you be willing to undertake just for a few more hours with a loved one? This is the question at the heart of ', ', the latest collaboration between Walt Disney and Pixar. The film finds two brothers on a hurried journey to complete a spell left to them by their long-deceased father. There’s a great deal of emotion loaded into the premise and the script injects a myriad of laughs through the creative manipulation of expectations the magical environment affords. Though loss is a central feature of ', ', there’s a pervasive hopefulness that brings a great deal of joy, even if it also elicits tears.', 'L-R: Barley voiced by Chris Pratt, Ian voiced by Tom Holland, and Julia Louis-Dryfus as Laurel in ONWARD.', 'A long time ago, there was magic in every corner of the world. It’s not just mermaids swimming the oceans, pixies flying the skies, or adventurers battling mighty dragons, but actual wielders of magic using their abilities to help those in need in a variety of ways. With the rise technological advancements, however, practitioners of magic slipped away until the existence of magic was considered nothing more than myth. That is, until Ian Lightfoot’s (voiced by Tom Holland) 16', ' birthday when his mother, Laurel (voiced by Julia Louise-Dreyfus), gifts him and his older brother Barley (voiced by Chris Pratt) a present from long-deceased father, Wilden (voiced by Kyle Bornheimer). This was no ordinary gift, but a spell which would enable Wilden to return for 24 hours. When the spell goes wrong and only half of their father returns, the two boys begin a quest to find the pieces they need to complete the spell before time runs out and they never seen their father again.', 'L-R: Ian voiced by Tom Holland and Barley voiced by Chris Pratt in ONWARD.', 'The average audience is likely unaware that the story for ', ' is a personal one. Inspired by his own experience with loss at a young age, director Dan Scanlon (', ') took the story of his and his brother’s loss and developed it, with Keith Bunin and Jason Headley, into the story and screenplay audiences see on-screen. At first, this sounds incredibly heavy: a tale of two sons desperately trying to gain time with a father they each barely knew, if knew at all. Ian was too young to remember his father and Barley only has three memories to speak of. Each wants more and the screenplay never downplays their emotional urgency, even when it means that these two Elfin boys must conjure gas from nothingness, evoke an disguise spell, and do far more to achieve their goal. Cleverly, each magical-based task serves the emotional cause, helping to move both Ian, a timid adolescent, and Barley, an effulgent dreamer, toward becoming capable adults.', 'Barley voiced by Chris Pratt in ONWARD.', ' is nothing if not well thought out. From the obvious triquetra t-shirt visible in photos of Wilden representative of Wilden and his sons, to the subtext of each trial the Lightfoot boys undertake, Scanlon, Bunin, and Headley ensure that every aspect of the world is fleshed out. It’s this level of detail which makes much of ', ' easy to connect with despite the barrier of (a) animation and (b) the fantasy elements that make up the entire film. So while it may be funny to see Barley rocking a denim vest adorned with heavy metal symbols and driving a patchwork van, a resplendent unicorn sprayed on the side, these represent more than just token attributes of a metalhead. From a different perspective, Barley is a historian of his native culture, unwilling to leave behind the traditions of his Elvin people in the face of modernity. From another, he’s entirely self-taught: driving a van he built himself without guidance, studying the past as a means of holding onto it. Played for laughs against Ian’s shyness and consternation, especially with Pratt’s Star-Lord-meets-Andy-Dwyer charm, Barley is a parfait of meaning in one character. This character also allows the film to suggest, though not explore, the deeper nature of turning our backs on our indigenous history and the dangers that come along with it. It would be a bold move for a Disney/Pixar film to take on such notions, and they come close here, but the film spends no time on it at all. Much of the conflict between Ian and Barley comes from their opposing views on the reality of their historical past: Ian accepting it to be simply stories, while Barley insists that it’s truth. The story sets up each one as correct, or each believing themselves correct, which is required for the two to address the suggested rift Ian has with his perceived screw-up brother. But by spending so much effort on fixing the rift, the larger notion of cultural erasure goes by the wayside. This, of course, makes sense in the larger sense as ', 'can best be identified as a cross between a coming-of-age tale and a road trip buddy comedy that just so happens to take place in a previously magical alt-future, and the exploration of that alt-future is less significant than the individual character journeys. For many, Ian’s story is the lead and requires the most storytelling to explore and grow. For this reviewer, there is nothing more devastating than Barley stating, “how can you call me a screw-up if you never let me try?” Somehow, this shattered me more than anything else.', 'L-R: Barley voiced by Chris Pratt and Ian voiced by Tom Holland in ONWARD.', 'Don’t fret. Amidst the themes of love, loss, and family, there’s plenty of Dad humor, too. It’s not just Colt Bronco (voiced by Mel Rodriguez), a police officer centaur who is dating Laurel and who struggles to connect with the boys, with his “working hard or hardly working” joke, but the way the designers for ', ' manifest Wilden: a literal pair of legs connected by a butt. And those legs put in the ', '. They manage to convey tenderness, affection, and even induce awkwardness that only a parental unit can. In one particularly silly moment, the legs take to dancing in the most off-beat rhythmic manner, unintentionally quelling a fraternal dispute. With the simplest of moments, the tension is gone and a lightness returns by the mere act of a butt wiggle. That’s the power of an awkward Dad, especially one who is admired so deeply by his kids. If the legs aren’t enough, you’ll enjoy seeing a gremlin as a pawn broker (voiced by a Tracey Ullman), a biker gang full of pixies, and majestic unicorns turned to something akin to feral raccoons. Truly, it’s a world of wonder, and it’s nothing if not willing to poke fun at itself to stay entertaining.', 'L-R: The Manticore voiced by Octavia Spencer and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Laurel in ONWARD.', 'This is where, however, a noticeable issue arrives. As engaging as the story is in its exploration of grief, it never seems to go all in on the implications of what this journey means. Pixar has never shied away from heady topics (one need only look at ', ' or ', ' to confirm), but ', ' seems to stop just short of a real emotional wallop in favor of a soft touch. This could be a result of Disney influence as the studio rarely wants to push its audience into serious areas of discussion, or just an aftereffect of trying to balance the light with the dark. More than any other Disney/Pixar film, ', ' doesn’t shy away from openly presenting loss and grief, it’s just that the film wants to wrap us up in a loving hug more than it wants to explore the emotions it evokes. Perhaps it only feels that way because the chemistry between Pratt and Holland comes across as absolutely natural. Honestly, the fact that the two got to record together in the same studio instead of working solo helps to bolster the performances and makes Ian and Barley seem more real. This will be fine for many as ', ' is bound to induce a great many tears in theaters, especially from the Brandi Carlile end-credit song “', ',” which sings the heart song of parents to their kids, kids to their siblings, and really anyone who’s ever felt the sting of loss.', 'Wherever you are in life, love and loss will touch you.

Everyone around them, including centaurs, pixies, and one very volatile manticore, were, at one time, inhabitants of an enchanted realm. In an amusing prologue, director Dan Scanlon (', ') walks us through how scientific progress like the mastery of electricity led to a rapid decline in the use of magic.

It seems like Dad may have left behind one last trace of the glorious past, a written incantation that, if spoken properly, will bring him back for one full day.

Ian (voiced by Tom Holland, current Spider-Man) and Barley Lightfoot (Chris Pratt, Marvel\'s Star-Lord) are pointy-eared blue elves. Their teenage years in suburbia are not especially magical or exotic. We sweat with the socially awkward Ian as he stumbles through inviting some semi-familiar classmates to a 16th birthday party he cancels in the same breath. Barley, meanwhile, has been stretching his ""gap year"" by mainly sitting around the house and playing an equivalent of Dungeons & Dragons. Barley is uniquely fascinated by the rich and whimsical history of the family\'s town, where wizards, quests, and magic once were all real forces, not just fodder for themed family restaurants.\r\n\r\n', ""For Ian's 16th, his mom (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) gives the boys something their late father left for them. It's a staff with a gem and instructions to bring back Mr. Lightfoot for one full day. Early on, the film has already tactfully established the void left behind by Dad's passing. Ian has no memories of his father and Barley only has three or four, yet Dad's shadow hangs over them, with Ian even editing an answering machine message to be able to simulate talking with him. So, the prospect of getting to spend 24 hours with the man who contributed half of their DNA is more than a little exciting for the brothers. Alas, in the tradition of Pixar complications, the spell doesn't work completely and Mr. Lightfoot has materialized as simply a pair of legs, dressed in loafers, pants, and his signature purple socks.\r\n\r\n"", ""Naturally, Ian, Barley, and Dad's legs embark on an adventure to get the rare stone needed to bring back the rest of Mr. Lightfoot temporarily. They're racing against the clock; the spell only lasts until the following day's sunset. But with Barley relying upon his knowledge of fantasy role-playing games and Ian utilizing common sense, the two hop into Barley's trusty, rusty van Guinevere and set their sights on the mountain believed to hold the uncommon gem they'll need to complete the spell, braving peril and biker pixies in the process.\r\n\r\n"", '\r\n\r\n', 'There are some unmistakable formulaic elements in play here, as ', "" assumes the mold of a road trip buddy comedy, a label you could apply to a number of Pixar's early films and countless other live-action and animated movies.

The notion of Pixar being a boys' club is about the only stinging, meaningful criticism that has been lobbed at the studio. While Scanlon, his fellow writers, and the two lead voice actors are all white men, the cast is otherwise quite diverse, with Octavia Spencer stealing scenes as family restaurateur The Manticore and Mel Rodriguez amusing as centaur police officer Colt Bronco (whom you might mistake for Pixar staple John Ratzenberger). There's even a scene in which Lena Waithe and Ali Wong voice police officers, with the former becoming the first openly lesbian character in a Disney-branded film. It's a small and easily forgotten moment that has already been taken to task by many who haven't yet seen the film, but the journey begins with one step and I don't see anything wrong with the treatment.\r\n\r\n"", 'What remains to be seen is how the public receives ', "".

Unquestionably, “with” always beats “without.” This wouldn’t be a proper escapade without paths of peril, a gauntlet of challenges, puzzles to solve, necessary items to seek, curses to avoid, experiences to be had, passions to ignite, and confidences to strengthen.

We follow young highschooler Ian Lightfoot (Tom Holland), who on his sixteenth birthday, receives a magical staff from his mom who tells him that it is a gift from his late father. The staff comes with a phoenix gem and an incantation that allows Ian and his brother Barley (Chris Pratt) to summon their dad back into the living, for one day.', 'Having never known his dad, Ian is bent on seeing his father but of course, the spell goes awry and their dad gets summoned halfway, with just the lower half of his body. That’s right, they did manage to summon their dad back, but only from his waist down.

Despite being the one gifted with magical powers, Ian has to constantly rely on Barley, with his rich knowledge of magic from long ago, for advice on how to cast spells. Through it, Ian learns the need to believe more in himself. It is a plot device we’ve seen a dozen times in a number of other movies, but what sets ', ' apart from many others is the brotherly bond Ian and Barley shares, despite the obvious differences in attitudes and outlook they both share.\xa0', 'From the very start, audiences see Barley as someone that is very outspoken about the love and support he has for his little brother – fetching him from school in his trusty (but decrepit) van Gwyniver, despite the embarrassment felt by Ian, following his brother on the quest for a phoenix gem so that Ian can see his dad for the first time, and imparting everything he knew about casting spells (through an ', ' guidebook) to his not-quite wizardly little brother.\xa0', 'Which makes the falling out they have in the film’s second act a little painful to watch – we have the idealistic Ian and the playful Barley realising that the siblings have fundamentally different approaches to life, and one cannot possibly match the other. This is a reflection of many sibling relationships and a condition worth exploring but sadly, the conflict lasted for less than 10 minutes and was quickly resolved in lieu of plot progression. It would have perhaps helped to shape the brothers’ personalities and their relationship a little more if the movie delved into their conflict and emotions more from the start, and not handwave it away with a quick goofy dance routine from their dad.', 'But given that this is a movie with fixed acts and a conclusion, the jump towards a reasonable conclusion has to occur and the Pixar perspective, of emotional revelation and understaning appears in the final moments when Ian learns of Barley’s own loss of never being able to say goodby to their father. For the majority of the movie, Ian’s motivation was to see his dad once again, having never met the guy before he passed away due to an undisclosed illness. He had plans to play catch with his dad, spend time having a heart to heart talk with him and get the man to teach him driving – then the movie decides to evolve the father and son relationship, and into the elder sibling one.', 'Following another argument between the brothers which has Ian leaving in a huff, he quickly comes to the realisation that though he has never had a dad, he’s had a great brother in Barley. If you’ve seen the trailers, or sensed there the story is approaching from, this eventuality was well orchestrated from the start, but the stakes were only raised towards the end. Perhaps the movie could have taken the time to develop the brother’s relationship a little more, but as it stands, there is more that Ian has picked up throughout the course of the movie, and there were sacrifices in the narrative that had to be done. The bottom line is, this is as much a movie about Barley, as it is about Ian.', 'Aside from Ian and Barley, ', ' also spends quite some time on Laurel Lightfoot (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), mother of Ian and Barley, and Corey (the ever spectacular Octavia Spencer), a manticore who the brothers first go to for help on their quest for the phoenix gem.\xa0', 'It is amusing to see how the once-mighty manticore and her tavern changed into a family-friendly restaurant over time thanks to capitalism and the need to keep her “investors” appeased. It was only after Ian gave her a speech on staying true to who she was that she strips off her demure persona and lets her mane fly free. Laurel also deserves special mention for taking the initiative to go after her boys right after she discovered them gone. If it weren’t for her, the climactic battle at the end would have gone pretty south we reckon.\xa0', 'In the end, much like any popular Disney movie, ', ' is all about the love siblings have for one another.

Having to give up dreams to pay the rent, staving off middle age – these are life’s curveballs little kids aren’t going to internalize as much, but they’ll love the adventure which comes of the need to replace a vital piece needed for the resurrection.', 'It’s a little like a mix of Harry Potter and ', ', even going so far as to visually reference the latter during a tense leap of faith.

One film-defining scene comes during a car chase where genuine sadness is felt over a personal sacrifice, but the sacrifice itself is full of self-satirizing hilarity. Scanlon and co-writers Jason Headley and Keith Bunin have found a curious and winning chemistry between sorrow and light; it’s not a chemistry which destroys the film, but rather gives it a gas which lifts it out of its formulaic trappings.', '‘s heavy subject matter dedicates itself to the kids who’ve been with Pixar from the beginning.

', '\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 One of the things I enjoyed seeing was the way that magic was used and established in the film, as during the time of the main story magic is almost archaic as the world has advanced so much. Without going into spoilers the story is pretty simple, Ian Lightfoot (Holland) is shy and nervous but is stronger than he looks, who never got to see his father when he was alive. While his older brother Barley (Pratt) is a magic fanatic who is never afraid of anyone or anything, and is always speaking in a grand and triumphant way. They are both the anchor’s to the film as the majority of the time is spent with their journey to see their dad one last time. If you saw the trailer you see how magical the movie really is in certain parts, especially with the state that the father is in. The way that the father is used provided a lot of comedy and some of the most heartfelt moments in the story that struck all the emotional cords. This movie has so much emotion but it doesn’t feel forced, and it feels very natural. Overall I really enjoyed this original, yet familiar story from the Pixar group. This is Disney’s first big movie of the year and it is certainly worth the time, especially if you are close with your father or brother. I’m excited to see what else Pixar has coming in the upcoming year and beyond! \xa0', 'The Verdict: 3.5/5', ' ', ' ', ' '], ['\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'Created with ', '\n', '\n', ' | '], [' is set in a fantasy world wherein magic has essentially faded away thanks to the convenience of technology.

Coming from Pixar though, this is a noticeable step down from their previous works. It never approaches the heights of something like Toy Story, Finding Nemo or even Coco. It’s a slightly unfair comparison, but considering the pedigree of what came before, it’s impossible not to do so.

It starts by showing how many years ago, these various entities existed in a world filled with magic and wonderment, until they evolved, and replaced spells with technology and modern structures and clothing.  The castles are gone, replaced with suburban homes, albeit houses that look like giant mushrooms.  Things like carriages are replaced with cars.

Yes, these are character straight out of roleplaying games… and they like playing roleplaying games – how’s that for “meta” storytelling?  Ian is also haunted by the deceased father he never got to know, as he passed away when Ian was just a baby.  As Ian comes up on his birthday, his mother decides to share something with both boys that their father left behind with the wish that they receive it when they’re both old enough.  It’s a magical staff, a “phoenix gem” and a spell that if carried out properly should bring the man back to life for one day, giving the boys a chance to spend time with him.  As “magic” is no longer practiced, they’re not sure this is even possible, but Ian seems to possess just a bit of it, and enacts the spell, which begins to manifest his pop from the feet up… only he fails halfway through, and now his dad is nothing but a waist, legs and feet.  To finish the spell, they must obtain another powerful phoenix gem, which isn’t exactly easy to find.  This leads the boys on a quest, so they hop into Barley’s van and hit the road hoping to carry out the mission before the day’s time runs out.

Chris Pratt and Tom Holland have great voice chemistry here, really selling these mismatched brothers who clearly have a strong family bond, even if they’re opposites in many ways.  Holland plays Ian as a timid boy who needs to grow up a bit, and Pratt plays Barley as the reckless brother who desperately needs some guidance and discipline.  It’s a bit like ', ' or ', ' within those character dynamics, and makes for a fun buddy pairing.  Their characters are in fact so likable, it makes up for the sometimes messy beats of the film that could have been much worse had the main two not been executed as well as they were.', 'The characters are the true strength of ', ', as the basic story is rather familiar and at times by-the-numbers.  Thankfully even the supporting personalities are all interesting and well depicted.  Laurel (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is the caring mother, but isn’t afraid to jump into action when her boys are in trouble.  Her current boyfriend “Colt Bronco” is a centaur (a half-man half-horse) voiced by Mel Rodriguez, and becomes an instant fan-favorite character thanks to his perfect vocal performance and visual gags that are really cute.  There’s also a band of biker fairies that become hilarious foils for our lead duo, and lead to a outrageous chase scene that is a true highlight for the film.  Another standout character is The Manticore, a winged demonic fire-breathing beast (voiced by Octavia Spencer) that is now managing a restaurant filled with entitled kids.  She’s left behind her more frightening ways, but becomes a clever muse for the boys when they seek her out hoping to find the gem.

Barley is, of course, excited, but Ian is elated. See, his father died before his birth, and Ian never met the man. Filled with angst and a million questions, they attempt the spell, but there is a mishap. The gem used in the spell imploded and only allowed the boys to bring the lower half of their dad back. Now they must go on a quest to retrieve another gem to complete the process before dad’s 24 hours are up.\xa0', 'The animation in\xa0', 'at times, was hypnotic. The bright and intricate color palette was mesmerizing, enhancing the film. The script by Dan Scanlon, Jason Headley, and Keith Bunin masterfully weaves in some very relevant themes of societal complacency into this narrative where, in this mythical world, all of these magical creatures have become lazy due to technology. Why use their magic if they can Google it? ', 'The dichotomy between Ian and Barley’s personalities is a crucial element of ', 'Ian’s shyness is due to not having a father figure in his life and Barley needs to be outgoing/positive because he felt the family needed those things after suffering tragedy at such an early age. Part of the magic this film creates is seeing the evolution of these two characters.

', ' also does a tremendous job of depicting what most would classify as the “modern family”. Even though Ian and Barley’s mother still misses their father, she’s moved on to a new boyfriend, Officer Colt Bronco (voiced by Mel Rodriguez) and the film brilliantly depicts the balancing act these families go through. Bronco tries to get close with the two boys but not too close because he doesn’t want to come on too strong. Their mother respects their passion for bringing back Dad but I’m not sure necessarily understands it. Scanlon’s film will certainly strike a chord with many in the audience.

It also drowns in grief, and flows in the unseen bonds that help us weather loss.

Nevertheless, magic itself isn’t assumed. Instead, wizards and witches, once powerful and necessary in the past, are mere folklore in the face of this modern technological world. Even so, on this day, it is Ian Lightfoot’s (Tom Holland) 16th birthday. A nervous elf and outcast, Ian’s never known his father. He died before he was born. Every night, he longingly stares at his dad’s picture and plays a cassette over and over with a snippet of his voice. However, Ian isn’t alone. His older brother Barely (Chris Pratt) fiercely believes in magic, and often plays a Dungeons and Dragons-esque game based on real historical legends. Moreover, Ian also has his determined and thoughtful mother (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and her campy cop boyfriend Colt Bronco (Mel Rodriguez), a centaur.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'On his 16th birthday, Ian and his brother are given a gift from their father, a magical staff with a spell.

For instance, their first stop finds them at the manticore’s inn. A fabled and powerful creature named Corey (Octavia Spencer), the manticore now runs the inn as a drab Chuck E.

Ironically, such contrivances reminds one of Disney’s pursuit in using the heritage of their past hits like ', ' and ', ' by remaking them for greater profits, even while they exhibit less soul than their predecessors.\xa0', 'Nevertheless, legacies can also guide us. Both Ian and Barley are completely reliant on the past, Ian for its emotional tendons connecting to paternal love not gained, and for Barley as a comfort to dissuade his unexpressed fears. The brothers use the power of legend and folklore to chart their quest, often learning to trust each other’s strength: Ian’s magic and Barley’s knowledge. It’s a leap of fate throughout, one the film intimates through allusions to ', ' (1989). And throughout, the two communicate with their semi-physically present father, even though he can’t hear them.\xa0', 'Less of an obvious visual splendor, the animated film doesn’t feature any splashy expressions of Pixar’s technical advancements through any one scene.

Moreover, Holland reprises his archetype of misunderstood bashful teen with surprisingly extraordinary powers who gains greater confidence the more he harnesses his abilities, to great effect. Because with each magical spell Ian learns on his road trip with Barley, the more he learns about his courage. Louis-Dreyfus’ charm also exudes in the delightful yet unassailable mother Laurel. And Holland and Pratt, both MCU stalwarts, show great vocal chemistry as two brothers bonded together through family and tragedy.\xa0', 'Lighthearted and funny, one scene in particular witnesses Ian and Barley zooming through a cave’s river on a giant Cheetos puff, ', ' morphs from standard Pixar faire to a heartfelt cry-a-thon by the final act. Losing a parent is never something you get over; their remains within you; and the memories of them in your mind become more cherished with each passing day.

This causes even more of the focus to go on the story and the film’s overall content.

A basketball phenom, he could have punched his ticket to college or even the pros, but, instead, he chose to walk away from the game, forfeiting his future. Jack's glory days are long gone...but, as it turns out, not forgotten. Years later, he gets the chance to take back his life when he is asked to coach the struggling basketball team at his alma mater. Jack reluctantly accepts, surprising no one more than himself, and as the boys start to come together as a team and win, he may get his last shot at redemption.""]";"[""The Way Back is a movie that is quite enjoyable especially if you are a fan of sports movies and love basketball. Ben Affleck gives a strong performance which feels very personal to him. This element heightens the film even more, it has a lot of things that you would find in the sports genre such as: Motivational scenes which make you feel good and make you want to support the characters. It doesn't oversimplify the game of basketball as well, the way they use strategies and plays feel like something you would actually see in a huddle of a high school basketball game and as a former assistant coach for a school basketball team I found that to be a really cool element. The way it handles the drama aspects outside of basketball and the real reason as to why the character is an alcoholic I found to be quite compelling and it felt quite emotional at times."", 'The film has a couple of drawbacks with the main one being that this is a little too cliched at times, a lot of tropes that you would see in sports films happen in this one, and I noticed that a lot of elements on the coaches interactions with the players were a little too similar to coach carter, which was a film that handled those elements better. Also the acting apart from Affleck for the most part was sub par, especially in the first act. The run time felt a little too long as well due to the fact that there were a lot of sub plots, I think it could have been better if they would cut some of them out to create a more tighter storyline.', ""Overall, I had a good time with the way back, i think if you're not a fan of the genre you wont find anything new here. However if you love sports, basketball and typical films in this genre you will have a good time like I did, and the awesome Ben Affleck performance is a bonus."", ""I have to say I really enjoyed this film. Affleck turns in possibly his greatest acting performance yet. The sports aspect was very well done but the emotional moments make the film. Definitely some hard scenes to watch at times. I think just as a basketball film it's quite solid, but the dramatic elements turn this into a great film. Highly recommend it!"", 'The dialog, acting, the characters, production value, etc. of this movie were excellent. It is a very honest representation of a man suffering with grief and alcoholism.', ""However, it suffers from being a retread of many other similar movies. You can trace the story arc easily and predict what will happen throughout. You also shouldn't go into this movie thinking it is a 'sports' movie, while basketball coaching serves as a vehicle of redemption, you could have written the same movie about someone taking a job teaching a class or working with special needs kids."", ""Finally, be warned that this is a very 'heavy' movie. There are a few lighter scenes, but >80% of the movie is dramatic and played for an emotional punch."", ""Worth a watch for Affeck's performance."", ""Love or hate Ben, he's nothing short of amazing in this film. Congratulations Ben! 👍🏻"", ""Formulaic trash about a guy I still don't give a stuff about."", ""Who doesn't like an underdog story but this one felt very personal everything about this movie shouts good I'm glad I watched this film"", ""Greetings again from the darkness. So much beer and booze. It would be easy to classify this latest from writer-director Gavin O'Connor as a sports movie. After all, he has given us two excellent ones in MIRACLE (2004) and WARRIOR (2011). However, as with those two films, there is much more going on here. This is about grief and addiction, and the difficulties in mending a life in tatters."", ""Jack Cunningham likes his morning shower. It helps get him prepare for a day of construction work and get over a late night of drinking. What's unusual about his morning routine is that he drinks a beer while taking his morning shower, and then fills his Yeti with gin as he takes his post at the building site. Jack is played by Ben Affleck, who has returned to the screen with a serious acting gig after his fling as Batman. Of course, anyone who even casually keeps up with Hollywood gossip knows Mr. Affleck and his character here have in common a drinking problem. In fact, the actor filmed this immediately after his latest rehab stint. It's quite possible that the collision of real life and fiction explain why this is Affleck's best performance in many years (at least since HOLLYWOODLAND in 2006). He re-teams here O'Connor, who directed him in THE ACCOUNTANT (2016)."", ""Jack is a former high school basketball star whose life has turned out much differently than expected. His construction job is beating him down, alcohol abuse is slowly destroying him, and he recently split with his wife Angela (Janina Gavankar) after a tragedy. Has he hit rock bottom? It's likely he thinks so. As happens so often in life, an opportunity presents itself. The head Priest at his former catholic high school asks him to step in as basketball coach after the current coach has a heart attack. The team is terrible, and has been that way since Jack graduated 25 years ago. After a painful-to-watch evening of decision-making, Jack accepts the job."", 'As you would expect, it\'s a team of misfits who have little concept of teamwork. Affleck excels as a coach who evaluates the talent he has and devises a strategy to not only improve individual player performance, but also inject the philosophies of teamwork and cohesion and commitment. He does this with the help of Algebra teacher slash Assistant Coach Dan (Al Madrigal, ""I\'m Dying Up Here""), who appreciates what Jack brings to the position, but is also protective of the boys and the school mission.', ""Jack manages to stay sober while coaching, but we see how fine that line is for an addict. Life suddenly rears up and plops an emotional situation that is simply too much form him to handle. It's here when we realize that while it appeared coaching the team gave Jack a glimmer of hope for a better life, it also allowed him to ignore the personal issues and relationships that had driven him to the bottle. The basketball scenes are the most fun to watch, but it's the realistic life elements that elevate the story. It's excruciating to watch Jack re-telling glory days stories to his 'buddies' at the local neighborhood bar, only to be helped home by the same old man who used to carry his father home from the same bar. The perpetuation of misery is a story that is all too relatable for many."", ""Jack's good qualities are evident when he's prodding ultra-quiet point guard Brandon (Brandon Wilson) into taking on a leadership role and thinking of his future, but that's contrasted with his inconsiderate treatment of his sister Beth (Michaela Watkins) and Father Mark (Jeremy Radin), the team/school Chaplain. It's the two sides of Jack that so clearly resonate with those who have experienced addiction. This is a guy who botched his college/basketball opportunity, but managed to build a new life, only to have it snatched away in the cruelest way possible. It's imperative that he come to grips with all of that in some place other than the bottom of a beer mug."", ""The outstanding screenplay comes from Brad Ingelsby (OUT OF THE FURNACE, 2013), and with director O'Connor and the cast, the film has a throwback to the 70's feel ... gritty and realistic. This is not the smirking, strutting stud we are accustomed to seeing with Affleck. He seems immersed in the role and brings an understanding to the struggles, the rehab, and the importance of a support system. Redemption played a huge part in the classic HOOSIERS (1986) and most every other rag-tag sports team in movies, and THE WAY BACK shows us there really is no going back ... instead, we must deal with life in order to move on."", 'The Act Of Ben Aflcek Incredble and The MoVie Also', ""IN A NUTSHELL:\nWarner Brothers presents a compelling story of overcoming one's worst self on the road to redemption. It's painful to watch since ¾ of the movie display a man's self-destructive behaviors over and over and over again. That man is portrayed in an outstanding, melancholy performance by Ben Affleck who reflects his own personal struggle with alcoholism in real life. It's one of Affleck's best and most honest performances to date. He's extremely believable as a blue-collar worker and Everyday Man. What's especially poignant is that he has recently admitted that his last trip to rehab was just a couple of years ago and that every day is still a battle. The movie is not the typical underdog story, but offers a more mature, realistic look at life. If you hate watching people implode by their terrible choices, this movie is going to be frustrating for you to watch. I wouldn't call it entertaining. I would call it insightful and poignant."", ""TIPS FOR PARENTS:\nLots of profanity. In fact, profanity is a running joke in the movie. Ben Affleck's character has a serious potty-mouth, which is a big problem for a guy coaching basketball at a religious school. He promises he'll work on it, but the F-bombs and other crude language continue to fly from the beginning to end of the movie.\nLots of bad behavior, such as dishonesty and self-indulgence.\nLOTS of destructive behavior such as alcohol drinking, drunk driving, infidelity, and pill-popping.\nYou see sick kids in a hospital with discussions of death.\nA man goes to rehab."", 'THEMES:\nRedemption\n""Just do all the little things right."" - Jack Cunningham (Ben Affleck)\nRespect\nFamily\nHope\nGrief\nAddiction\nChoices, consequences, and accountability\nIn the team practice after each basketball game, Coach Jack would ask the players, ""What did we learn about ourselves last night?""

Then, in Act 3, we finally get to see the cliched sports movie give us the triumphant scenes we want to see. But wait, there is an Act 4 that catches us off guard. That\'s where the heft of the movie takes an unexpected turn and provides meaty insights.', ""THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nThere is a lot of basketball talk, as you can imagine, so if you're not into basketball, you might get a little tired of all that. It's a sports movie, so you can still understand the ups and downs of team drama.\nI'm assuming Cutter's beer paid dearly for the product endorsement, since you see a LOT of scenes with Ben Affleck guzzling it.\nThere's an exposition scene where one of the characters has to explain how high the stakes are so we care.\nI started to get the feels, but I never actually broke down and cried. I felt like the emotional pull could have squeezed even harder.\nA few times the camera moved around so fast that I actually got dizzy and had to look away from the screen.\nWhile it's somewhat cliched and predictable for a feel-good sports movie, it's missing the obligatory training sequence in a musical montage. ha ha\nThe movie really focuses on Ben Affleck's character, so we don't get to learn a lot about the players on the basketball. A few of them have identifiable characteristics but the movie just doesn't dive deep into them.\nThe friend of mine who watched the movie with me said he would have walked out during the first Act because he just can't stand watching people drink themselves to death on screen. He was glad he stayed until the end but he said the powerful message at the end wasn't worth having to sit through all of the tragic self-destruction in the majority of the film."", 'You can read the rest of my movie review on Movie Review Mom (dot) com or on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.', 'My Review / The Way Back\nMy Rating 6.5\nBen Affleck is a fine Actor and very impressive in the role of Jack Cunningham a former champion Basketball player who is now clearly an alcoholic wanting to block out his young sons death and his broken marriage .

Affleck has also accepted that the second word in Alcoholics Anonymous does not apply to him - certainly not after he (briefly) relapsed in the fall, turning up smashed on TMZ a few months after making it known that he had achieved one year of continuous sobriety.', 'Why did he choose to make a movie about an alcoholic?

When he isn’t at the bar, Jack is emptying a fridge full of beer at home. He’s grown distant from his family and has been separated from his wife (Janina Gavankar) for over a year. Jack’s life is given purpose again when he’s asked to coach his old high school team, which hasn’t made it to the playoffs since he was a student in the 90s. While the team doesn’t look like much, some tough love from their new coach just might take them to the big leagues while giving Jack a shot at redemption.', ' does admittedly sound familiar on paper. The setup is not only reminiscent of other sports dramas, but another movie starring another Affleck: ', '. In that film, Casey Affleck also played a depressed loner who’s driven away from his wife and finds new meaning when he’s asked to care for a teenage boy. There’s even a revelation in the second act of ', ' that ties into the central theme of ', '. For all the familiarity, though, there is a fair deal that sets ', ' apart from the rest.', 'It’s refreshing to see a sports drama that was made for adults. Jack’s players don’t talk like the sanitized teenagers you’d see in a Disney sports movie. They talk like the foul-mouthed, politically incorrect teenage boys you’d find in any real high school. Jack isn’t afraid to speak their language either, demonstrating that he can trash talk as well. It’s not the excessive swearing that makes ', ' an adult sports movie, though. The screenplay tackles serious issues, from alcoholism to loss, and much of it rings true. Every time it seems like the film may cop out with an inspirational sports cliché, it rebounds with a brutal dosage of reality.', 'Although Jack’s life improves through his coaching duties, winning a few games can’t erase the sins of the past or the demons within. The ending in particular is far more bittersweet than triumphant. That may be the best way to describe Affleck right now. While Affleck has come a long way as of late, he’s still had the occasional professional setback like ', ' and ', '. He’s also endured his fair share of personal struggles, finalizing a highly publicized divorce in 2018 and opening up about his history of alcoholism earlier this year. Affleck draws on much of his own experiences here, but not to the point that it becomes self-indulgent. This is an emotionally raw, deeply personal performance from Affleck that ranks among his absolute best. Whatever lies on the horizon for Affleck, ', 'is a testament to how far he’s come as an actor and leaves us all feeling more optimistic.', ""Nick Spake has been working as an entertainment writer for the past ten years, but he's been a lover of film ever since seeing the opening sequence of "", "".

The result is a film that makes the path to basketball glory and the road to personal redemption seem oddly effortless.', ' opens with a well-observed sequence introducing us to Jack Cunningham (Ben Affleck), the former high school basketball star who’s become a drunk. Jack guzzles a cold one in the shower first thing in the morning, and as soon as he gets off work, he fills a cup full of beer for the drive home. He’s a barely functioning alcoholic who’s isolated himself from his concerned but withholding sister (Michaela Watkins) and still pines for his ex-wife (Janina Gavankar), who’s moved on with her life since their separation. These early scenes are lived-in and naturalistic, evoking Jack’s aimlessness and repressed anger without obvious cues.', 'Jack receives a lifeline in the form of an offer to coach the basketball team at his alma mater, Bishop Hayes High School. The team has fallen on hard times, as enrollment at the school has declined over the last couple decades. At first, he’s resistant to the idea, practicing his rejection speech over and over while getting drunker and drunker before eventually passing out; Jack’s increasing belligerence offers a sad and darkly funny showcase for Affleck’s tightly coiled yet surprisingly expressive performance. Ultimately, Jack relents and, after some growing pains, whips six shrimpy, unformed kids into an unstoppable force racking up win after win.', 'As a teenager, Jack turned down a full-ride basketball scholarship to the University of Kansas—an act of spite against his opportunistic father, who never took an interest in his son except when he was on the basketball court. Jack has paid dearly for that decision, spiraling downward into addiction, despair, and a total rejection of the game he once loved. ', ' generates a compelling and refreshingly small-scale sense of emotional tension as Jack, for the first time since high school, re-enters the world of sports that he left behind, bringing his repressed rage to the game as he curses out refs and entreats his squad to throw elbows and play rough: “I will not coach a team that has been out-toughed!”', 'In these early scenes, O’Connor seamlessly unites the two strands of this narrative (Jack’s addiction and the team’s development), but Ingelsby’s script doesn’t quite seem to believe in the power of its own simple premise. Melodramatic subplots are piled on top of each other, including one revelation about an hour into ', ' that feels like emotional extortion. This needless upping of the stakes comes at the expense of the film’s supposed raison d’etre: Jack’s relationship with the kids he’s coaching. Only one of the players, Marcus (Melvin Gregg), even registers as a full-fledged character, but the shy star of the team still comes loaded up with an overwrought backstory that all too neatly parallels Jack’s daddy issues.', ' climaxes, as it must, with an all-or-nothing showdown against Hayes High School’s powerful arch rivals. But, in the film’s smartest and most resonant move, one that cleverly exposes the artifice of its own genre conventions, this big game doesn’t resolve much of anything. Instead, it’s merely the momentary high before Jack hits the lowest of lows. After he gets fired from the team for showing up to a practice stinking of booze, Jack goes on a bender that ends with him crashing his car, stumbling into the wrong house, and getting severely roughed up in a confrontation with the homeowner. For a moment, ', ' seems to be the rare sports film that recognizes that the gritty glory of competition can’t solve all your problems. Ultimately, however, it succumbs to the demands of its genre, with a final passage that cross-cuts between scenes of Jack in rehab and shots of his players excitedly rallying themselves for their first playoff game by shouting, “Win this one for Coach Cunningham!”—all while Rob Simonsen’s score, which shamelessly apes Vangelis’s iconic ', ' theme, gradually swells to a mawkish crescendo.', 'O’Connor has a knack for rendering even the corniest sports-movie clichés with a quiet naturalism that almost makes you forget how many times you’ve seen this sort of thing before.

Aside from a well-composed set piece laying out a particular play, there’s scarcely a memorable moment of game-playing in the whole film. And, more problematic, there’s not enough to convince us of any real bond between Jack and his players. How do they get so good so fast?

But it also refers to the young, wannabe triad member with the unlikely name of Autumn Moon (Sam Lee), as well as to the production circumstances of the film itself. Its declarative label is somewhat excessive, though, as there’s no mistaking where and when Moon’s misadventures take place: Chan’s quirky, gangster-adjacent flick, so infused with washed-out and blue-filtered imagery, presents a portrait of Hong Kong that bears more than a passing resemblance to Wong Kar-wai and Christopher Doyle’s early collaborations.', 'From its handheld shots racing through open-air markets, to its use of expressionistic step-printed slow motion, to the way its perspectives on the city take inspiration from the cramped geometry of tiny Hong Kong flats, ', ' owes a lot to Wong’s breakout work. The content and structure of the story, too, is reminiscent of ', ' and ', '. Moon, a youthful and essentially innocent small-time loan shark, narrates his chance encounters and near-misses in the city in a naïve, contemplative voiceover. Although there’s no lack of plot, the film is as much about milieu as it is about events; its rather loose cause-and-effect sequence allows it to soak in the atmosphere of Moon’s subjective world.', 'The threads of the story weave in and out of each other in an almost desultory manner. Moon and his buddy Sylvester (Wenders Li, performing a broad, offensive caricature of an intellectually disabled gangster) discover the bloodied suicide letters of a teen girl named Susan (Amy Tam Ka-Chuen) and must deliver them to their intended recipients. The pair encounter Ping (Neiky Hui-Chi Yim), the daughter of one of the debtors they’re meant to shake down, and Moon promptly falls in lust, creating a conflict of interest with his mob boss, Brother Wing (Sang Chan). After discovering his father has absconded with a mistress, Moon periodically arms himself with a meat cleaver, vowing to avenge this betrayal of his mother (Doris Yan-Wah Chow), even if she doesn’t seem to care very much. She dissuades him at first, and after he resumes the quest later, he’s given pause when, en route to take out his dad, he witnesses another son dismembering a father in a restroom stall.', 'Throughout Chan’s film, comic irreverence intermingles with cosmic coincidences—shades again of the Hong Kong we know from ', '. If ', ' faces reasonable charges of derivativeness, it doesn’t help that the beautiful Ping—who turns out to be dying of renal failure and in desperate need of both cash and a set of kidneys—sports Faye Wong’s iconic pixie cut from the former film. (Ping, never much of a character in her own right, might be described as a depressive pixie-cut dream girl.)', 'Still, it’s difficult not to get caught up in the film’s frantic tour through Hong Kong—and through Moon’s juvenile head space. An inveterate wet-dreamer whose daily morning routine involves rinsing out his underpants, Moon tells us about his distinctly un-erotic, cum-centric fantasies, to which we’re also given visual access: shooting ejaculate at the low-flying airplanes that perpetually pass over Hong Kong’s urban mass, or, in another recurring dream, imagining the blood running from under Susan’s mangled corpse transforming into milk-white liquid. All of Hong Kong seems little more than some version of Moon’s dreamworld, but reality is encroaching, in the form of death. As Moon says the last time he dreams of Susan, “There were tears on my face instead of cum—were they Susan’s?”', 'This line’s mixture of crassness and melodrama lands, but overall, ', ' doesn’t successfully execute its pivot from the irreverent to the sincere, once things get serious for Moon. With its quick cuts and frenetic camerawork, it succeeds in capturing the pounding exuberance of being young in an urban environment—as in ', ' and Godard’s ', ', surely other reference points for Chan, some of the film’s best shots are just its misfit characters running in spaces they should know better than to run in—but it doesn’t manage to fuse this rebellious energy with the Wong-ian wistfulness it evidently aims for.', ' ', ' Sam Lee, Neiky Hui-Chi Yim, Wenders Li, Amy Tam Ka-Chuen, Sang Chan, Doris Yan-Wah Chow ', ' Fruit Chan ', ' Fruit Chan ', ' Metrograph Pictures ', ' 109 min ', ' NR ', ' 1997', 'So many grandiose tactics portend a grander revelation than the film’s otherwise low-key three-hander delivers.', 'Published', 'on', 'By', 'riter-director William Nicholson’s ', ' dutifully but monotonously traces the dissolution of a nearly 30-year marriage. Where the garrulous, headstrong Grace (Annette Bening) finds herself still fighting to save the relationship despite her constant disappointment, Edward (Bill Nighy) is tightly wound, reserved, and seemingly content to quell arguments, his irresponsiveness only further permitting a build-up of resentment. Their bickering appears to be a daily routine, with almost every one of their fights cut short by Edward leaving the room. But Nicholson’s script fails to give either of them much specificity beyond their polar-opposite behaviors. They’re more archetypes of a feuding couple than flesh-and-blood people who were in love with one another at some point in their lives.', 'Nicholson’s failure to probe Grace and Edward’s interior landscapes, or even get at the root problems of their marriage, only makes the film’s attempts at big emotional gestures feel all the more hollow. Indeed, both are so thinly conceived that we learn virtually all we will about them by the time they split a half hour into the film. The arrival of their twentysomething son, Jamie (Josh O’Connor), throws a potentially interesting kink into the mix, especially when it’s revealed that Edward requested his son’s presence so that someone could help him cushion the emotional blow of Grace being told that he’s leaving her. But rather than explore the dysfunctional context of this father-son relationship and whatever led up to such a callous, manipulative decision, Nicholson settles for propping Jamie as the helpless middleman between his mother, who refuses to accept that her marriage is over, and his father, who quickly absconds to shack up with his mistress, Angela (Sally Rogers).', 'Nicholson adapted ', ' from his own 1999 play ', ', and its stagebound origins are apparent throughout. While Bening brings an underlying warmth to her role that could easily have been simplistically shrill in another actor’s hands, the other performers are more visibly constrained by the flimsy characterizations offered to them. Any signs of the spontaneous messiness, rage, and sorrow that accompanies most divorces are smoothed over by dialogue that’s so precisely phrased that it’s rendered listless. All the while, the filmmaking exudes the generic sheen of prestige picture, especially across the long, sweeping drone shots of the cliffside U.K. town of Seaford, where the film is set.', 'For being so disconnected from the drama at hand, the panoramic beauty of those interludes is as jarring as the voiceovers of Grace quoting John Keats’s poems and Edward laboriously recounting tales of soldiers who leave the wounded behind in order to assure their own survival. All are grandiose tactics that portend a grander revelation than the film’s otherwise low-key three-hander delivers. But most damning is the shortage of quotidian details that might have given us a richer sense of the lives lived and marriage lost in this patch of the world.

And there’s evil in selfish refusals masquerading as ethical stances.', 'In fact, for Rasoulof, evil seems to be the most significant organizing force of daily life—the evil of past actions, present decisions, and atemporal structures—in a culture such as Iran’s that accepts murder as a legitimate form of punishment.

It ponders, instead, how citizen’s position themselves in relationship to the inevitable evil that runs through their country’s core, architecting its every corner and generations of people.', 'Each section of the film is independently titled and abides by a different genre, and as such could function as a standalone short. The first is arguably the strongest because we’re still oblivious to the games Rasoulof may want to play with us. The filmmaker masterfully plays off of our ignorance, spending almost the entirety of the segment making us believe in a realistic portrait of the everyday life of a perfectly happy, and drama-free, middle-class family in Iran, saving one of the most unexpected plot twists in all of cinema to the very last shot.', 'In retrospect, Heshmat’s (Ehsan Mirhosseini) life should have been too good to be true. When we first meet him, he’s playing the neighborhood hero, saving a kitten stuck in a hole. He then patiently listens to his wife’s (Shahi Jila) infinite list of mundane complaints as he drives, in a lengthy sequence that recalls Abbas Kiarostami’s ', '. We also see Heshmat vacuum his elderly mother’s entire apartment, tenderly dye his wife’s hair after helping her pick out the right color, and being an example of honesty at the local grocery store. It isn’t until we’ve grown completely accustomed to the idea that there is no “catch” to this portrait of family life in Iran that Rasoulof punches us in the gut with a flawlessly timed denouement.', 'The jolt is at once affective and intellectual, as you may feel as if you understand the film in an instant, as an uncompromising exposure of the banality of evil, then spend the rest of it nursing your shock. It’s clever for Rasoulof to not use the structure of the first segment, with its last-minute narrative blow, as a model for the ones that follow. Rather, ', ' takes the shape of a filmic anthology, as if multiple directors with distinct sensibilities had been asked to share their musings on the same topic: the various shapes that guilt and honor (or lack thereof) might take in a context of state-sanctioned death. Through this chameleonic approach, Rasoulof unravels the various conceptual threads that emerge from the first story with shorts that are still full of suspense and mystery but that allow us to situate ourselves much sooner, and as such participate in the drama in a more cerebral fashion.', 'In another impeccably orchestrated segment, we find a soldier, Pouya (Kaveh Ahangar), wallowing in despair as he awaits the order to execute his first prisoner. The story evokes Dostoevsky, as our reluctant hero spends the night with his barrack mates discussing the many ways he can escape his predicament, all of which seem to lead to a dead end still teeming with some fatal injustice. It’s just a question of who will end up pulling the trigger, or pushing the stool, in a world where all bodies are marked to either slay or be slayed.', 'The ending here is also shocking. Not because it suddenly illuminates a crucial blind spot in our understanding of the story, but due to its unexpected playfulness. The idea of captive life already being a kind of death takes shape through a sudden genre transition when the film surrenders to the lightheartedness of a musical.

In Milan, an art critic, James Figueras (Claes Bang), delivers a lecture, promoting a book he’s written tellingly called ', '. James discusses a primitive-looking yet bold painting involving yellows and slashing gestures, which he initially writes off before switching gears with an elaborate story of loss that inspired the artist to create it. After this tale, the audience is ready to buy prints of the work, until James confesses that he’s lying; he himself painted it thoughtlessly. James has asserted his power as a critic, as a conveyor of meaning, to arouse interest in something without value.', 'This scene is intercut with moments in which James practices his lecture in a bathroom, a device that emphasizes the contrivance of his performance. James, then, has broken a cardinal rule of criticism that many critics are tempted to violate: to not dictate the terms of art-making. James’s elitism is so pronounced that he feels that virtually no one can tell the difference between “real” and “fake” art, and so he will take it upon himself to dictate reality in order to sell his writing and perhaps future derivative paintings, which he can render “good” through the power of his erudition, rationalizing, and gift for myth-making. James is a frustrated creative, like Lee Israel in Marielle Heller’s ', ', who illustrates the potentially murky boundary separating the politics of the art industry from fraudulence. James has come to utilize notions of reputation and canon, which are complicated and dependent on class and power anyway, as bolsters of an elaborate shell game.', 'Bang is at ease with James’s un-likeability—and his confidence is among ', '’s most reliable pleasures. As in BBC’s recent, uneven ', ' miniseries, Bang emits here an aura of boredom, intelligence, and mild amusement that could mask an abyss of cruelty; his handsomeness and peerless diction are subtly menacing. As such, we feel protective of Berenice Hollis (Elizabeth Debecki), a young woman who meets James at this lecture and quickly sleeps with him. Berenice also presents herself as tough, but Debecki allows you to feel Berenice’s effort, there’s nothing of James’s bitterness in her. Soon, they’re in Lake Como at the sprawling country home of art gallery owner Joseph Cassidy (Mick Jagger), where James could land the assignment of a lifetime: an exclusive interview with reclusive artist Jerome Debney (Donald Sutherland), a man of mystery who lives in a studio on Joseph’s estate. Joseph wants James to wrangle from the old man something he can sell.', 'Capotondi and Smith don’t allow this mother lode of backstory to overwhelm the film, as they whittle it down to a series of verbal duels, in which James, Joseph, and Jerome debate the semantics of art and art-creation against the gorgeous backdrop of Joseph’s estate. ', ', the title of which is a despairing parody of critical pretension, is essentially a sun-dappled essay on male egocentrism. And, unlike many recent greed parables, it bothers to empathize with the draw of wielding power, of keeping the company of gorgeous and charismatic young women, and of walking into a room knowing everyone inside wants what you have. In other words, the film allows that we are complicit in privilege for our fascination and envy, and Jagger’s stunt casting opposite of Bang is an especial masterstroke.', 'Jagger is, of course, far more successful than even his character, and here he radiates an effortless cynicism and self-satisfaction, barely papered over with courtesy, which is deeply amusing and resonant. Joseph is a commanding, charismatic embodiment of privilege, and Jagger’s svelte wielding of his own legend-hood serves to put the comparatively unknown Bang up on his figurative haunches, a relationship between actors which embodies viscerally the relationship between their characters. James is a wannabe, whereas Joseph is a player.', 'Sutherland offers the audience a reprieve from the film’s central big-dick contest, giving Jerome a courtly decency that testifies to the optimism that can drive artistic creation, which can get lost among the politics of distribution, accumulation, and analysis. The truth of Jerome’s current artistic output isn’t a surprise, and it leads to acts of violence that are common of thrillers, somewhat compromising the film’s lingering, mysterious air of possibility. This routine plotting is a disappointment coming from Smith, who wrote the novel ', ' as well as its screenplay adaptation, both of which tracked terrifyingly plausible descents into violence. However, ', ' ends on a lovely, bittersweet note, in which a piece of art finds an audience of one, who regards it with nothing more or less than the piercing human love that led to its very creation.', ' ', ' Claes Bang, Elizabeth Debicki, Mick Jagger, Donald Sutherland, Rosalind Halstead, Alessandro Fabrizi ', ' Giuseppe Capotondi ', ' Scott B.

But like a lot of Hollywood dream-workers, Pixar’s storytellers also believe in believing. And faith in something, ', ', is essential to the studio’s latest feature, ', ', as the heroes of this comic fantasy are two teenage elves who go searching for the magical gem—and the self-assurance—needed to briefly resurrect their departed and sorely missed father. On the occasion of the film’s release, join us in revisiting the Pixar canon, ranked from worst to best. ', 'The effect of the ', ' films is practically primal. They appeal to anyone who’s ever cared about a toy—one they outgrew, gave away, or painfully left behind somewhere. These films, with scant manipulation and much visual and comic invention, thrive on giving toys a conscience and imagining what adventures they have when we turn our backs to them. Conversely, the effect of ', ' and its infinitely ', ', toons about dudes-as-cars not quite coping with their enormous egos and their contentious bromances, is entirely craven in the way it humorlessly, unimaginatively, and uncritically enshrines the sort of capitalist-driven desires Pixar’s youngest target audience is unable to relate to. Unless, that is, they had a douchebag older brother in the family who spent most of his childhood speaking in funny accents and hoarding his piggy-bank money to buy his first hot rod. ', 'Maybe it’s my general aversion to Nascar, or anything chiefly targeted at below-the-line states. Maybe it’s that Larry the Cable Guy’s Mater is the Jar Jar Binks of animated film. Or maybe it’s just that a routinely plotted movie about talking cars is miles beneath Pixar’s proven level of ingenuity, not to mention artistry (okay, we’ll give those handsome heartland vistas a pass). Whatever the coffin nail, ', ', if not its utterly needless sequel, is thus far the tepid, petroleum-burning nadir of the Pixar brand, the first of the studio’s films to feel like it’s not just catering, but kowtowing, to a specific demographic. Having undeservedly spawned more merchandising than a movie that’s literally about toys, ', '’s cold commercialism can still be felt today, with a just-launched theme park at Disneyland. And while CG people are hardly needed to give a Pixar film humanity, it’s perhaps telling that this, one of the animation house’s few fully anthropomorphic efforts, is also its least humane. ', ' has poignant moments, particularly when a human boy teaches Arlo, the titular protagonist, how to swim in a river, and there are funny allusions to how pitiless animals in the wild can be. But the film abounds in routine, featherweight episodes that allow the hero to predictably prove his salt to his family, resembling a cross between ', ' and ', '. There’s barely a villain, little ambiguity, and essentially no stakes. There isn’t much of a hero either. Arlo is a collection of insecurities that have been calculatedly assembled so as to teach children the usual lessons about bravery, loyalty, and self-sufficiency. ', ' is the sort of bland holiday time-killer that exhausted parents might describe as “cute” as a way of evading their indifference to it. Children might not settle for it either, and one shouldn’t encourage them to. ', 'It’s perfectly fair to walk into ', ' with a wince, wondering what ', ' hath wrought, and lamenting the fact that even Pixar has fallen into Hollywood’s post-recession safe zone of sequel mania and brand identification. What’s ostensibly worse, ', ' jumps on the prequel, origin-story bandwagon, suggesting our sacred CGI dream machine has even been touched by—gulp—the superhero phenomenon. But, while admittedly low on the Pixar totem pole, ', ' proves a vibrant and compassionate precursor to ', ', the kid-friendly film that, to boot, helped to quell bedroom fears. Tracing Mike and Sulley’s paths from ill-matched peers to super scarers, ', ' boasts Pixar’s trademark attention to detail (right down to abstract modern sculptures on the quad), and it manages to bring freshness to the underdog tale, which is next to impossible these days. ', ' is content to explore the end of Lightning McQueen’s (Owen Wilson) career with a series of pre-packaged sports-film clichés—an old dog trying to learn new tricks, struggling with a sport that seems to have passed him by, and facing, for the first time in his career, a sense of vulnerability. The template turns out to be a natural fit for the ', ' universe, organically integrating racing into the fabric of the film and rendering it with a visceral sense of speed, excitement, and struggle. Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo) is a welcome addition, a plucky foil to McQueen who’s also a three-dimensional presence in her own right, much more richly developed than one-joke characters like Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) and Luigi (Tony Shalhoub). Cruz’s presence also allows the filmmakers to bring some social conscience to this sometimes backward-looking franchise, exploring the discouraging pressures placed on young female athletes while also nodding toward the historical exclusion of women and racial minorities from racing. ', 'For those who waited patiently for the first Pixar film to be led by a female protagonist, it’s understandable that ', ' might have been a disappointment, arriving after the studio hit its artistic peak, and suffering from a handful of authorship woes. But the feminist fable remains the most underrated of this revered brand’s lot, not least because of Princess Merida’s eye-popping head full of aptly unruly hair. The movie may enchant with its focus on Scottish lore (an element arguably explored better in ', '), and it may deserve a hand for its girl-power, who-needs-a-husband trajectory, but the distincitve bit that puts the lump in your throat is the mother-daughter story. From ', ' to ', ', ', ' to ', ', princess tales almost always deal with the heroine’s link to a father or an evil mother surrogate, never an actual mom who imposes relatable, resonant rules. This far more interesting dichotomy gives ', ' an especially fresh and expressly female perspective. And while Merida’s mother’s transformation into a bear may seem gonzo and random, it’s actually perfectly appropriate: Together, mother and daughter must fight to undo a beast of a burden, one that’s historically, symbolically masculine in nature. ', ' doesn’t have a distinctive visual style, but it does showcase Pixar’s trademark mastery of depth, light, and shadow. As in Dan Scanlon’s ', ', the fanciful and the everyday are well harmonized. That’s still a neat trick, but it’s no more novel than Ian (Tom Holland) and Barley’s (Chris Pratt) experiences. Animated features often borrow from other films, in part to keep the grown-ups in the crowd interested, but the way ', ' recalls at various points ', ', ', ', and ', ' feels perfunctory and uninspired. And it all leads to a moral that’s at least as hoary as that of ', ' or ', '. While ', ' begins as a story of bereavement, it soon turns to celebrating the payoffs of positive thinking. That you can accomplish whatever you believe you can is a routine movie message, but it can feel magical when presented with more imagination than ', ' ever musters. ', 'The gentle counterpart to Dreamworks Animation’s ', ', ', ' deals in a wealth of familiar themes and narratives, peddling the importance of community inherent to ant populations, positioning unlikely hero Flik as a fish out of water when he seeks help for the colony, and reinforcing the tyke-targeted notion that “being small isn’t so bad” (a maxim preached to young ant Dot, voiced by a very young Hayden Panettiere). But when Flik, a “country bug,” goes searching for warriors to combat the ants’ oppressive grasshopper nemeses, and instead returns with a ragtag troupe of circus insects (think the gang from ', ' performing amid the carnival debris of ', '), a more intriguing theme emerges. As the actors and acrobats help the ants to craft a massive bird (a salvation-bringing idol that will hopefully scare off the enemy), they also introduce art as an alternative to fear and violence, and the film presents entertainment as something not just diverting, but heroic. ', 'Driven by the potency of its social intentions, Eliza Hittman’s film is so authentically felt that it becomes hyper-real.', 'Published', 'on', 'By', 'liza Hittman’s ', ', a slice of life in a neorealist vein, is a bravura depiction of the social barriers that get in the way of women asserting their agency. Quiet and perpetually dressed in a hoodie, 17-year-old Autumn (Sidney Flanigan) is first glimpsed at her Pennsylvania high school’s ‘50s-style talent show performing a cover of the Exciters’s 1963 hit “He Got the Power,” whose lyrics include “He makes me do things I don’t want to do/He makes me say things I don’t want to say.” Between this, the barbershop quartet at the ready, and the students dressed as Elvis Presley, Hittman pointedly ironizes an ostensibly enlightened present’s nostalgia for a regressive past.', 'Autumn is increasingly detached from her family, including her mother (Sharon Van Etten). She only really connects with her cousin, Skylar (Talia Ryder), with whom she works at a grocery store where everyone, including their manager, leers at them. Soon, a pregnancy test confirms what Autumn had already suspected. We don’t know who the father is, and that doesn’t really matter. After reading a few adoption pamphlets, and trying to induce a miscarriage by brutally punching her belly, Autumn decides to have an abortion. But there’s one problem: In Pennsylvania, a parent is required to give permission for an underage person to have the procedure. And so Skylar and Autumn steal from the cash register at work and grab a Greyhound to New York together, where an abortion should be slightly easier to obtain.', 'After the bus soars past post-industrial Pennsylvania and heads into a tunnel, plunging ', ' into momentary darkness, we’re teleported to Manhattan, and the effect is nothing less than electric, redolent of the entry into the Zone from Andrei Tarkovsky’s ', '. Hélène Louvart’s 16mm cinematography never smacks of easy nostalgia, as there’s a distinctly modern quality to the grain and flattened colors of the film’s images. There’s a limber quality to the handheld camerawork, a delicacy to the way it almost seems to caress characters’ faces. As envisioned here, New York suggests an alien world, the shallow focus reducing figures on busy sidewalks to glowing shapes of various colors.', 'Plagued by setbacks, Autumn and Skylar have to stay in the city overnight, and as they have no money for a hotel, they’re forced to sleep inside bus and subway stations. It’s as if the city is turning against them, but when they find a late-night arcade, there’s a pointedness to the kaleidoscopic presentation of the scene. Here, Hittman’s sensuous filmmaking stands in sharp contrast to the harshness of the subject matter, as she neither loses sight of the miserable nature of Autumn and Skylar’s situation nor their desires for more than just security. These are two very normal girls, and their ordinariness, as they struggle to navigate spaces that are built for men to stare at women from behind one-sided mirrors, or to trap them behind a cash desk, underscores the life they can’t have. But the arcade, with its ', ' machine and Tic-Tac-Toe-playing chicken, still offers them a kind of escape.', 'Hittman’s dreamy coming-of-age stories at times suggest something from the Larry Clark school of provocation, where a certain penchant for transgression comes at the expense of verisimilitude. But the strength of this film is that its transgression comes from the shock of how the abortion system works. How each thing that ostensibly keeps people safe is harmful in a different way. Use your invaluable health insurance, and the procedure will show up on your parents’ statement. Spend the stolen cash to pay for it instead and you can’t buy a ticket home. This approach might be didactic at times, but Hittman’s screenplay manages to capture the interlocking effects of wider, separate issues with impeccable precision. Medicare for all, toxic masculinity, the working class, pro-lifers, homelessness, and privatization of public space—all are gestured to without moralizing or pontificating. It’s all in service of character.', 'The political centerpiece of the film is the scene that gives it its title, in which Autumn is made to respond to “personal questions” with the answers “never,” “rarely,” “sometimes,” or “always.” It’s then that she can go through with her abortion. All of the questions involve increasingly violent situations with men. And in one elongated close-up, the extent of Autumn’s experiences to date are painfully suggested across her face. “I want to make sure you’re safe,” says the counselor, who’s literally only looking to check the right boxes and send Autumn on her merry way. Driven by the potency of its social intentions, ', ' is so authentically felt that it becomes hyper-real, a nightmarish disquisition about how entire systems are rigged against women that would feel academic if it didn’t play out against earnest performances of tender teenage emotions.', ' ', ' Sidney Flanigan, Talia Ryder, Théodore Pellerin, Ryan Eggold, Sharon Van Etten ', ' Eliza Hittman ', ' Eliza Hittman ', ' Focus Features ', ' 101 min ', ' PG-13 ', ' 2020', 'It’s difficult to imagine a more socially engaged or powerful condemnation of the exploitative gig economy than Ken Loach’s latest.', 'Published', 'on', 'By', 't’s difficult to imagine a more socially engaged or powerful condemnation of the exploitative gig economy than Ken Loach’s ', ', which places the viewer on the ground with an English family trudging through the muck left behind by the erosion of workers’ rights in Europe. Here, the supposed economy of free choice promulgated by neoliberal policies manifests as a domestic realm in which one’s job penetrates into every waking moment, leaving stressed bodies and minds with no time and little wherewithal for a personal life or obligations. Global forces control the fate of the family at the story’s center, in ways not immediately apparent on the individual or family level. As Ricky (Kris Hitchen) plaintively puts it late in the film, “It just seems to me that everything is out of wack.”', 'The fulcrum on which Ricky’s life teeters is the small black scanner he carries with him as a delivery person for a private parcel service. The all-powerful scanner tracks the packages he rushes to destinations around his former mining town, as well as Ricky himself, keeping him synchronized to a precise delivery schedule that he can be punished severely for falling behind on. The black box itself also constitutes a symbol of his extreme employment precarity, as the company he works for (the fictional PDF) supplies him with one of the expensive machines, and he would be on the hook for a thousand pounds if it were to be broken or lost.', 'Through the device of the scanner, Loach and screenwriter Paul Laverty no doubt intentionally evoke the bicycle from Vittorio De Sica’s ', '. They revealingly suggest that the gig economy promises little more but a return to pre-prosperity conditions for Europe’s working class, sold under the pretense of expanded autonomy and opportunity. Though Ricky answers both to the black box and Maloney (Ross Brewster), an imposing, unforgiving boss, he ostensibly serves as a “franchisee,” the owner of his own business and master of his own destiny—the overt scam by which large companies like Uber circumvent labor laws and outsource the costs of operation to their employees (sorry, “independent contractors”).', ' you opens with Maloney explaining the job in such terms to Ricky, but, piece by piece, the film rends apart the image constructed by Maloney’s con-man pitch. In Loach’s unadorned, social-realist style, we see Ricky’s life begin to crumble as anxieties mount: the behavioral issues of his teenage son, Seb (Rhys Stone), are exacerbated by Ricky’s increased hours away from home; his daughter, Liza (Katie Proctor), still a tender 11 years old, suppresses the trauma of the family’s increasingly tension-filled lives; and Ricky is progressively alienated from his beloved wife, Abbie (Debbie Honeywood), whose perpetual self-sacrifice at work and home seems to be for naught. The six-day-a-week job Ricky needs to survive proves lacking in any of the flexibility that would allow him to address these compounding family crises and any of the protections that would facilitate recovery from his work-borne fatigue and the acts of God that eventually beset him.', 'The viewer accompanies Ricky on his deliveries, showing the day-to-day difficulties a courier copes with in dealing with a broad range of individuals caught up in their own world and oblivious to his. But Loach also devotes stretches of the film to other members of the family; most prominently, the film speaks to the current labor market’s degradation of human dignity through Abbie’s struggle to work while keeping her family together, stable, and healthy. Abbie cares for elderly hospice patients, making in-home visits to keep them company and assist them in moving, eating, and using the restroom—for which she’s paid a mere pittance and, like Ricky, must contend with a dehumanizing management that perpetually pushes her work hours into her family time. Through Abbie’s conversations with Mollie (Heather Wood), one of her patients and a former labor organizer, that Loach and Laverty deliver the reminder that the battles that need to be fought today have been waged before—and won.', 'The characters, each wearied by the constant stress of this economy are played with an understated realism that’s startling in the context of the typical melodrama through which poverty and social crises are usually addressed. To Loach, social problems cannot be distilled into melodrama’s abstractions, as the dignity in labor and life slipping out of the characters’ worlds stems from their material conditions, not from inner psychological states or idealist values. One could describe Loach’s depiction of the disintegration of this working-class family unit as emotionally devastating—and it absolutely is—but to leave it there would be to miss the point.

Naps on top of rickety mattresses or hotel room beds that recall Melanie Schiff’s “Sleeping Boy” photo series, in the ominous ways these images of sleep suggest symptoms rather than the body’s clockwork going through its motions.

It’s a small music box, which the young man, touched by the gesture, is quick to wind so he can finally listen to what he has to say, even if by proxy.', 'It’s easy to feel as if the film’s pathos begins to slip through Tsai’s fingers as we listen to the melancholy song produced by the music box. On screen, such a memento is often used as a symbol for sorrow, and as such would appear to be at odds with the director’s penchant for ambiguity. Yet Tsai is quick to deliver us from hackneyed territory by having the young man wind the music box again and again and again, turning the prop into something else altogether.

Whether they’re furnishing vendor carts in the German countryside (', ') or attempting to reestablish an identity in the wake of World War II (', '), Petzold’s characters seem to cling to romance as a stabilizing force in turbulent times.

The film’s opening shot is fixed on the electric orange curls of Undine’s (Paula Beer) hair as she sits, downcast, at an outdoor café. She’s being dumped by her wealthy boyfriend, Johannes (Jacob Matschenz), an affront that she attempts to combat with semantics. When this fails, she tells him, “If you leave me, I’ll have to kill you. You know that.” This is a succinct enough summary of the myth ', ' takes as its source text, in which a sprite is given human life after she falls in love with a man who she insists must remain faithful to her.', 'Petzold shoots that breakup in a tight shot-reverse shot sequence, emphasizing the bland, molded sympathy of Johannes and Undine’s alert, probing micro-expressions. The scene’s realism is interrupted twice: by a church bell that elicits both a tear from Undine and a slight, spectral rising of music on the soundtrack; and by the flip phone that Undine opens to reexamine a recent voicemail. As this typically compact but deceptively rich film moves along, such flashes of dislocation proliferate, undermining ', '’s seemingly contemporary setting and leaving us to wonder whether love and logic are compatible.', 'The film gambols between tones from the outset, rushing Undine, a historian who traces the expansion of Berlin over centuries, to a presentation on local architecture and then back to the café where, hoping that Johannes has changed his mind and opted to stay with her, she meets Christoph (Franz Rogowski), a goofy industrial diver who fixes bridges and dams. Their mutual relationship to both the water and industrial infrastructure is sanctified in a meet-cute involving a broken aquarium and a whispered voice from another realm. Christoph and Undine’s love—a romance that plays out like a piece of mystical/screwball fan fiction for ', ' obsessives agonized by that film’s fateful vicissitudes—instantly feels complete.', 'While ', ' luxuriates in the gushiness of Christoph and Undine’s mutual attraction, Petzold also takes pains to frame his romance around Berlin’s evolution from a modest trading hub to a locus of international division to, finally (or at least for now), a mirror of the urban creep of gentrification and fad economies. (It’s worth noting that the café Undine returns to repeatedly is housed in an old church.) And this commentary takes the form of lectures delivered by Undine at the Senate for Urban Development and Housing, in a room dominated by scale models depicting Berlin’s sprawl over the past few centuries.', 'Her speech on the Berlin Palace, an imperial hub dating back to 1443 that was destroyed 500 years later and is currently being rebuilt to house a museum, refers to the “phantom pain of a violent amputation” that must be reclaimed in a modern context. “Progress is impossible,” she hypothesizes, but individuals and the broader public nonetheless long to make a performance of healing. This poignant speech is one of the few moments where Undine seems to obliquely reference her identity as a once- or semi-aquatic creature. Petzold’s concise narrative has plenty on its mind, but it’s challenging to reconcile the fantastic nature of his premise with the relative lack of importance it attaches to Undine’s actions or philosophy.', 'Progress, like romance, moves in cycles, and Undine’s speech augurs the return of Johannes to her psyche. Their chance meeting opens up a rupture in Christoph and Undine’s heretofore unalloyed mutual affection, and as Petzold ushers his lovers toward doom, the film almost seems to rewind, revisiting most of its settings and turning sites of passion into mausoleums of aching and regret. “Form follows function,” Undine says in one of her presentations,” and with minor alterations in framing and presentation Petzold fundamentally shifts our sense of these locations.

All of these scenes taking place in this Central American past are drowned in ranchera music so that we understand that we are no longer in Brooklyn but in Mexico, and that while Molly’s supposed selflessness is so quick to turn into passive aggressiveness, Latinx people are just really dramatic all the time.', 'These flashbacks are also meant to explain what set off Leo’s mental breakdown and, yes, it most likely has to do with the loss of a baby. As if these memories weren’t trite enough, and made even more cringe-inducing by unexplainable and overtly aestheticized shots like that of Leo lying on a bed of corn, Potter also takes us back in time to a moment of paternal abandonment steeped in trite melodrama.

Part of that comes from intentional narrative devices that help the film in some ways and hinder it in others. Also, this is just a really raw film at times looking at a subject material that is both important but also deeply relevant to the lead actor. Which gets us into the realm of how much of this is performance and how much of this is reality thrown up on the screen. All of these are difficult things, but they were because in many respects this is a difficult film.', 'So to set the scene, Jack Cunningham (Ben Affleck) spends his days alone, even when he is surrounded by people. He wakes up with a beer, he showers with a beer, he drinks on the way to work, he hides booze while he is working, and he drinks himself silly when he gets home. After Thanksgiving dinner with his sister Beth (Michaela Watkins) who is clearly concerned that he is not seeing anyone after his marriage with Angela (Janina Gavankar) fell apart he arrives home to find an odd message on his phone. His old school wants him to come back and be the new basketball coach.', 'First, we need to explore the good and by the good, I mean the uncomfortable. Of course, this is the acting of Ben Affleck who headlines this film in more ways than one. This is very much his film, in that he is playing the central character and it is also this is covering subject matter like divorce and alcoholism that is quite personal to him. This is clearly apparent at the start where you see the brutal reality of someone who has become dependent on alcohol to make it through the day. Those moments when Jack is interacting with the kids, and the other priests throughout the film are completely charming and you can’t help but get caught up with it all. When Jack starts dropping f-bombs on the court in front of Dan (Al Madrigal) and Father Whelan (Jeremy Radin) was both hilarious but also really telling because it is the only thing bumping this up to an American-R rating, so it was a real choice to keep it in.', 'Where the film does not work as well is in the pacing, especially at the start. This is a film that takes a long time to get going, part of that is just taking too long to ground the film, one shower-beer shot was enough to let us know. But also part of it was the way they structured the film for some reveals we will talk about next. To go with this, another area where the film really needed some work was with the banter between the cast. I know they were setting up an awkward/uncomfortable vibe but you can do that and still have clever dialogue.', 'Now, I need to discuss some of the structural aspects of the film, but that is going to move us into [', '] territory. This is a film that actively preys on you as an audience and how you perceive information in a narrative. At the start of the film, Jack is asked if he has any kids and he says no, which is both true and also an obscuration. But you as an audience take it at face value only to be slapped in the face by the truth later on. It was really effective in the moment, as that dawning revelation becomes clear. Unfortunately, while it works in the moment, because the film spends most of its runtime hiding it in the background, they didn’t provide the groundwork that you needed to make what happens in the third act work. To go along with this, in many respects this is a film that is presented as a standard redemption-through-coaching narrative and there is even a moment when the film freeze-frames right at the moment when you would expect that kind of film to end. However, this is not the end of the film, but rather the end of the second act. I am personally not a fan of films that present themselves as one thing when they actually want to be something else. It is a really fine balancing act, which most films can’t pull off, but I think ', ' did.', 'In the end, do we recommend ', '? Yes, yes we would. It is a hard film to watch at times, indeed I don’t think it ever gets easy. However, there are some really powerful performances, it is dealing with themes that we need to explore, and it might be some of Ben Affleck’s best work.

That’s probably to hide the alcohol he keeps in his coffee mug, which was preceded by the beers he had at breakfast, or the one he had in the shower. At nights, he keeps ice cold brews on standby in the freezer, swapping them out with well-practiced ease. This is when he bothers to even be at home, and not at the nearby bar tossing them back with the other regulars.', 'A lean yet powerful drama, The Way Back doesn’t cut any corners or short-shrift on Jack’s anguish. Nor does the script by Brad Inglesby (Out of the Furnace) do much dawdling; within minutes Jack is asked by Father Devine (John Aylward) back to his alma mater, the parochial Bishop Hayes high school, to fill-in as head coach for their struggling basketball squad.

The team is, predictably, quite awful and a bunch of knuckleheads. They have talent but no ability to work as a unit. Jack steps in and immediately overturns the apple cart. He’s stuck with the team’s mousey but loyal assistant/algebra teacher (Al Madrigal, low-key great), who is willing to let Jack’s abrasive language and methods slide because he’s a proven champ. When players get out of line, Jack is quick to punish, but he also instills in them a toughness they never had.', 'The team’s successful turnaround is key, but never overpowers the arc Jack truly needs. That’s not something we’re ever led to believe he’ll find by winning a big game. “You have to chip away at it”, he tells the team as they claw back from a possible blowout. But that might as well be a metaphor for Jack’s life, which we later learn has been racked by unbearable tragedy. The arrival of ex-wife Angela (Janina Gavankar, terrific as always) reveals the depth of the misfortune both have suffered. It drives Jack’s self-destructive tendencies but is never framed as an excuse for them.', 'We’re seeing the emergence of Affleck and O’Connor as one of those star/director duos that work better together than with anybody else. Having previously collaborated on the hitman savant film', ', they instinctively know when to let the other take charge. Sometimes that means letting Affleck fully drop his guard, perhaps pulling from his own personal reservoir of regrets, to express Jack’s sorrow over past mistakes. O’Connor plays fast and loose with the basketball scenes, although they have the authentically-messy feel of high school competition. He often chooses to skip past the embarrassing losses, all in service of getting back to Jack’s story away from the court. It’s a decision some will find frustrating, but this isn’t a basketball movie. It’s a life movie, with basketball as just another component. The players’ individual struggles don’t really resonate as a result, although many are teased. Jack’s story, while always compelling in a “When will he hit rock bottom?” way, could’ve used some pairing down. The question lingers as to why his basketball career ended, but the reveal is forced and unsatisfying. It’s enough to know that it was derailed, we don’t need the specifics to sympathize with him.', ' constantly upends genre expectations, taking a full-court view of what it means to win at the game of life.\xa0 Affleck, who has made no secret of the impact making this movie had on him, is deserving of whatever praise comes his way.

Is The Way Back a little gooey? Sure. For having such a raw personality, Jack sometimes feels out of place against the typical cast of misfits that populate the teams in these kinds of films. And there are a number of moments where I rolled my eyes because of their obviousness.

Janina Gavankar (as the wife) and Michaela Watkins (as the sister) are underused unfortunately. They do a good job with grounded performances, but they seemingly exist only to ground Jack and to try to help him recover from his demons. Putting female characters on the sidelines (both literally and figuratively) is a common problem of sports movies unfortunately.', 'But in reality, Affleck’s Jack is in pretty much every scene of the movie and it’s his character’s story that is really being told.

The obvious parallels between his real life and the character have been commented on by nearly everyone on his press tour and review of the film.

Though not the most agonizing depiction of addiction (which might have to go to Michael Fassbender in ', '), it’s emotional seeing his life being pulled apart by his addiction.', 'Ultimately, the film takes a turn from traditional sports films to focus on Jack’s demons. The team wins an important game, but the film doesn’t show them going into the playoffs or championship. O’Connor deviates from that genre. He shows how alcoholism is a parasite infecting Jack’s life. Unfortunately, it isn’t a fully-examined look into addiction. The film explains away the alcoholism by a troubled relationship with Jack’s father and a family tragedy (not to say that these can’t be contributing factors). The “resolution” after he hits rock bottom feels a little too quick. This is one of the few movies that might have benefit from an extra 20 minutes just to make the end’s pacing not feel rushed.', 'In the end, it feels like O’Connor tried to tell two stories – the underdog sports film and the alcoholism story. By trying the straddle both, neither works fully. He does do a decent job with both storylines, admittedly, but how much the film works for an audience will ultimately depend on how hard either of these halves of a story works for each viewer. The more critical and callous will see through all the genre troupes and be unimpressed. Those who are more along for the ride and wear their hearts on their sleeves will be entertained by well-done basketball scenes and cry at a sad tale of Affleck mirroring his own struggles on screen.

In real life, he’s gone through two collapsed superhero cycles, an auteur phase, and a high-profile failed marriage, leaving him near 50 and (reportedly) alone. In the film, he plays Jack Cunningham, a California high school basketball legend who gave up the game, took up drinking, and now spends his days working construction and nights at the bar. The narrative attraction between actor and role is obvious—and what the entire film is counting on.', 'With his days blurring together, a nudge is all Jack needs to take over as his former school’s basketball coach. The team is bad and, naturally, it’ll be up to him to turn things around. As with everything else in Jack’s life, it’s a tall order. As co-written with Brad Ingelsby, O’Connor folds this sports narrative—complete with vibrant player personalities and Al Madrigal as their nebbish assistant coach—into a broader tale of alcoholism and despair, the details of one filling in and informing the other. The film’s layers take some time to peel back—and there are perhaps one too many—but the payoff is heartrending nonetheless. With respect to O’Connor’s tactile and unobtrusive direction, the credit for ', '‘s shape and momentum must be given to Affleck. He clearly knew what he was doing in taking this role, and he sells it for all its worth, easily transcending the film’s cliched trappings and messaging.', 'Now I must admit to experiencing some PTSD while watching parts of ', ' Not because I’m an alcoholic, a struggling construction worker, or approaching divorce, but because of the basketball. This film so understands the specific stress of high school competition it becomes easy to forgive the excesses and trust its choices instead. It knows winning a basketball game can’t cure alcoholism, resolve grief, or erase regret, but it can remind a man like Jack (or perhaps Ben) of what else he can lose. And that there’s time still left on the clock.', 'Daniel is a writer and editor whose work can be found online, in comic books, and — if you ask nicely — a few screenplays. He labours as a municipal employee when not discussing, thinking, or writing about film. Just mention Star Wars or The Third Man and watch him go on and on.', '\xa0  | \xa0 ', ' \xa0 | \xa0', '\xa0 | \xa0', ' \n\n', 'Copyright © 2017 Brief Take. All Rights Reserved. \n']]"
